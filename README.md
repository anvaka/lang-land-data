# Lang Land Data

This repository contains geospatial data for my new project - a map of words. I'm learning Chinese and thought it could help other students too.

This map shows around 5,000 Chinese words from the HSK vocabulary list. I arranged the words so similar ones appear closer together - it's like a landscape of meaning that helps me see connections between words.

More information coming soon as I'm releasing this project

Feel free to play with it here: https://anvaka.github.io/lang-land
