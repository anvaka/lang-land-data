# **海拔 (hǎi bá) - Altitude / Elevation**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **海 (hǎi)**: means "sea." Radical "氵" (three dots water, left); main part "每" (right).  
- **拔 (bá)**: means "to pull up." Radical "扌" (hand, left); main part "犮" (right), which shows the action of pulling.

**Examples**:  
- 这座山的海拔很高。(Zhè zuò shān de hǎi bá hěn gāo.) - The altitude of this mountain is very high.  
- 珠穆朗玛峰的海拔超过八千米。(Zhū mù lǎng mǎ fēng de hǎi bá chāo guò bā qiān mǐ.) - Mount Everest's elevation exceeds 8,000 meters.  
- 飞机正在海拔一万米的高度飞行。(Fēi jī zhèng zài hǎi bá yī wàn mǐ de gāo dù fēi xíng.) - The airplane is flying at an altitude of 10,000 meters.

**Usage Notes**:  
海拔 (hǎi bá) is mainly used to describe the elevation of a place above sea level, commonly seen in geography and travel contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 海 (hǎi, sea) + 拔 (bá, lift): "Lifted up from the sea" = height above sea level.
