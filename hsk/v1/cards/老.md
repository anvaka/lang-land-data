# **老 (lǎo) - old; aged; experienced**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **老** (lǎo): Top: “⺹” (lǎo, ancient form hinting "old"); Middle: “匕” (bǐ, spoon, often a component in older characters); Bottom: a hook stroke, signifying age and bending.

**Examples**:  
- 他很老。(Tā hěn lǎo.) - He is very old.  
- 老师教我们中文。(Lǎoshī jiāo wǒmen Zhōngwén.) - The teacher teaches us Chinese.  
- 老朋友见面很高兴。(Lǎo péngyǒu jiànmiàn hěn gāoxìng.) - It’s nice to meet old friends.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **老** (lǎo) is used for both age (old in age) and respect (e.g., **老师** (lǎoshī), “teacher”; **老王** (Lǎo Wáng), “Old Wang”).  
- Placed before surnames/nouns for familiarity or affection.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think of the bending strokes at the bottom as the bent back of an elderly person.  
- “Lǎo” sounds like “low”-as in old age, when energy tends to be lower.
