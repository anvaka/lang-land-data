# **泄气 (xièqì) - To lose heart; to be discouraged; to leak air**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **泄** (xiè): "to leak, to let out." Left: "氵"(three-dots water) radical, indicating relation to liquid. Right: "世" (shì) suggesting phonetics.  
- **气** (qì): "air, gas, breath." Top: "气" itself derives from steam-like pictograph, meaning "air/energy."

**Examples**:  
- 你别泄气。(Nǐ bié xièqì.) - Don't get discouraged.  
- 球泄气了。(Qiú xièqì le.) - The ball has lost air.  
- 他因失败而泄气。(Tā yīn shībài ér xièqì.) - He was discouraged by failure.

**Usage Notes**:  
**泄气** (xièqì) is used for both people (“to lose spirit”) and objects (“to leak air”). Negative or disappointing contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine **气** (qì) (air) is slipping out (like water 氵 from the left side of **泄** (xiè)), symbolizing both leaking air and losing motivation.
