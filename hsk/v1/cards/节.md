- 节 (jié): Top is 艹 (cǎo) "grass" radical, suggesting something plant-related. Bottom is 即 (jí) phonetically; 口 (kǒu) "mouth" on the left/bottom, 卩 (jié) "seal" on the right/bottom.

**Examples**:  
- 春节 (chūn jié) - Spring Festival  
- 一节课 (yī jié kè) - one class period  
- 节约用水 (jié yuē yòng shuǐ) - use water sparingly

**Usage Notes**:  
节 (jié) is used for festivals, class periods, musical measures, bamboo joints, and idioms about saving (节约 (jié yuē)). Placed after numerals to count class periods or events.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of a bamboo "section" (节点 (jié diǎn))-each "节 (jié)" separates and organizes, just like how festivals or lessons segment the year or a day.
