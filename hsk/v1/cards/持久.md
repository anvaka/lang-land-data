# **持久 (chí jiǔ) - Long-lasting; enduring**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **持** (chí): "to hold, maintain." Left: 扌(shǒu) hand radical; right: 寺(sì), originally "temple" but here for sound.  
- **久** (jiǔ): "long (time), lasting." Upper left: 丿(piě), a stroke; bottom right: 勹(bāo) wrapping component; inside: a small dot, suggesting "long time wrapping around."

**Memory Aids**:  
- **持** (chí): Imagine your "hand" (扌shǒu) "holding" on for a "long time" (久jiǔ).  
- **久** (jiǔ): Looks a bit like something wrapped, as in time wrapping around itself.
