- 丛 (cóng): Composed of two primitives.
  - Top: 从 (cóng) "to follow" (two people, side by side, one following the other)
  - Bottom: 又 (yòu) "again" or sometimes "hand"  
- The whole character suggests things clustered or grouped together (like many things following or gathering).

**Memory Aids**:
