# **掰 (bāi) - to break apart with hands**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 掰 (bāi): On the left is 扌 (shǒu) "hand" radical. On the right is the character 分 (fēn) "divide" on top, and 又 (yòu) "again/hand" at the bottom. Together, they suggest "using hands to divide."

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 用 (yòng) 力 (lì) 掰 (bāi) 开 (kāi) 了 (le) 面包 (miànbāo)。 (He broke the bread apart with force.)  
- 请 (qǐng) 掰 (bāi) 一下 (yíxià) 这个 (zhège) 棒子 (bàngzi)。 (Please break this stick apart.)  
- 我们 (wǒmen) 把 (bǎ) 饼 (bǐng) 掰 (bāi) 成 (chéng) 两半 (liǎng bàn)。 (We broke the cake into two halves.)

**Usage Notes**:  
- 掰 (bāi) is usually used for breaking something into pieces by hand, not by cutting. It's common for food or objects that can be snapped or split manually.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think of 掰 (bāi) as using your "hand" (扌 shǒu) to "divide" (分 fēn) something. Imagine splitting bread with both hands.
