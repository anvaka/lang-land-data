**Character Breakdown**:  
- 鲜 (xiān): Top: "鱼" (yú, fish radical), Bottom: "羊" (yáng, sheep). Originally relates to "fresh," as fish and sheep are fresh foods-extended to mean vivid.  
- 艳 (yàn): Left: "丰" (fēng, abundant), Right: "色" (sè, color). Suggests abundant color, thus "bright" or "brilliant."

**Memory Aids**:  
- 鲜 (xiān): Imagine a "fish + sheep" at the market-both look freshest and brightest.  
- 艳 (yàn): "Color" (色 sè) and "abundance" (丰 fēng) = an abundance of color =鲜艳 (xiān yàn)!
