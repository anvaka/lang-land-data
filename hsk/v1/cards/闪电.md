- 电 (diàn): "electricity." Top is 雨 (yǔ, "rain" radical without last stroke); bottom is 申 (shēn, "to stretch" or "state"), commonly associated with things related to electricity or thunder.

**Usage Notes**:  
闪电 (shǎn diàn) is a noun. Often paired with 雷 (léi, "thunder"), as in 闪电雷鸣 (shǎn diàn léi míng, "thunder and lightning"). Used in weather discussions or metaphorically for something quick.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine a person (人 rén) inside a door (门 mén) reacting quickly to a sudden flash (闪 shǎn), and "electricity" (电 diàn) often comes with lightning in the rain (雨 yǔ). Think: "Lightning (闪电 shǎn diàn) flashes through the electric (电 diàn) sky."
