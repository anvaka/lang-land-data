# **灭亡 (mièwáng) - to perish; to be destroyed; extinction**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **灭** (miè): "to extinguish, to destroy." Top: 灬 (huǒ, fire radical) beneath a small stroke, representing putting out a flame.  
- **亡** (wáng): "to perish, to lose." Top: 亠 (tóu, lid radical); below: 亡 itself suggests fleeing or vanishing.

- **亡** (wáng): "Gone under a lid," like something lost and covered forever.  
- **灭亡** (mièwáng): Both characters suggest being "extinguished" and "gone," i.e., complete disappearance.
