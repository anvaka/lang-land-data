# **呢 (ne) - particle (question/soft tone)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 呢 (ne):
  - Radical: 口 (kǒu) "mouth" on the left - indicates sound or speech.
  - 余 (yú) on the right - phonetic component, gives the pronunciation.
  - The whole character suggests something being spoken or asked.

**Examples**:  
- 你呢？(nǐ ne?) - And you?  
- 天气怎么样呢？(tiānqì zěnme yàng ne?) - How’s the weather?  
- 这是谁的呢？(zhè shì shéi de ne?) - Whose is this?

**Usage Notes**:  
- 呢 (ne) is often used at the end of a question for emphasis or to "bounce back" a question ("And...?").  
- Softer than 吗 (ma), and often used in follow-up or context-specific questions.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 口 (kǒu) "mouth" asks, "What about...?"  
- 呢 (ne) sounds like "néh?" as in "what about that?" in English.
