# **僵硬 (jiāng yìng) - stiff; rigid**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 僵 (jiāng): Left - 亻 (rén, person radical); right - 疆 (jiāng, border/limit). Suggests a person who has reached their limit-becoming "stiff."  
- 硬 (yìng): Left - 石 (shí, stone radical, "rock" or "stone"); right - 更 (gèng, more). Denotes something as hard as a rock.

**Examples**:  
- 他的动作很僵硬。(Tā de dòngzuò hěn jiāngyìng.) - His movements are very stiff.  
- 气氛变得有点僵硬。(Qìfēn biàn de yǒudiǎn jiāngyìng.) - The atmosphere became a bit awkward.  
- 她的表情很僵硬。(Tā de biǎoqíng hěn jiāngyìng.) - Her expression is very rigid.

**Usage Notes**:  
僵硬 (jiāngyìng) describes both physical stiffness (body, objects) or figurative stiffness (atmosphere, attitude). Can modify nouns or verbs.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine a "person" (亻 rén) so stiff they are like a "rock" (石 shí). Their motion stops at the "border" (疆 jiāng) of movement, becoming rock-hard (硬 yìng).
