# **必然 (bìrán) - Inevitable; certain**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **必 (bì)**: "must" or "certainly." The main component is "八 (bā)" on the top, representing division, over "心 (xīn)" (heart) at the bottom-suggesting something the heart must do.  
- **然 (rán)**: "so; like that." Left side is "灬 (huǒ)" (fire) at the bottom, showing things burnt, and the right has "月 (yuè)" (moon) on top of "犬 (quǎn)" (dog). Together, they imply a natural result.

**Examples**:  
- 失败 (shībài) 是 (shì) 必然 (bìrán) 的 (de)。- Failure is inevitable.  
- 他们 (tāmen) 的 (de) 胜利 (shènglì) 并非 (bìngfēi) 必然 (bìrán)。- Their victory is not certain.  
- 努力 (nǔlì) 会 (huì) 带来 (dàilái) 必然 (bìrán) 的 (de) 回报 (huíbào)。- Hard work will definitely bring rewards.

**Usage Notes**:  
必然 (bìrán) is an adjective or adverb meaning "inevitable," often used before a noun or as a predicate. Common structures: 必然 (bìrán) + noun or verb; 非 (fēi) 必然 (bìrán) (not inevitable).

**Memory Aids**:  
“必 (bì)” = must; “然 (rán)” = like it is. If something "must be so," it is 必然 (bìrán)-inevitable!
