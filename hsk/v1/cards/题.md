# **题 (tí) - Question; problem; topic**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 题 (tí): Left-“⻍” (辶 chuò, “walk” radical) suggests action or movement.  
Right-“是” (shì) (“is/yes”) indicates sound and meaning. Together, implies something “put forward for discussion.”

**Examples**:  
- 我不会这道题。(Wǒ bù huì zhè dào tí.) - I can’t solve this question.  
- 请你出一道题。(Qǐng nǐ chū yī dào tí.) - Please come up with a question.  
- 他的题写得很好。(Tā de tí xiě de hěn hǎo.) - His questions are written well.

**Usage Notes**:  
题 (tí) is used for quiz/test questions, topics, and problems. Often paired with 道 (dào) as a measure word.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 辶 (chuò) “walking” towards a 是 (shì) “yes”-to reach the answer, you walk towards “yes” through a question (题 tí).
