# **籍贯 (jíguàn) - Place of origin / Hometown (specifically ancestral home)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **籍 (jí)**: "register; record" - left: ⽲(艹, "grass" on top); right: ⾁(⾁, "meat/flesh" inside), ⼨("inch" at the bottom right). Indicates official or archival documents.  
- **贯 (guàn)**: "thread through; link" - top: ⺮(⺮, "bamboo" radical); inside: 毌(guàn, "string together"). Historically related to threading coins or linking together.

**Examples**:  
- 你的籍贯(jíguàn)是哪里？(Nǐ de jíguàn shì nǎlǐ?) - Where is your ancestral home?  
- 他虽然在北京(Běijīng)长大，但籍贯(jíguàn)是上海(Shànghǎi)。(Tā suīrán zài Běijīng zhǎng dà, dàn jíguàn shì Shànghǎi.) - Although he grew up in Beijing, his ancestral home is Shanghai.  
- 填写表格时需注明籍贯(jíguàn)。(Tiánxiě biǎogé shí xū zhùmíng jíguàn.) - You need to specify your place of origin when filling out forms.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 籍贯(jíguàn) refers to the ancestral or family home, not necessarily where you were born or live.  
- Common in official documents, registrations, and self-introductions.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 籍(jí) is like a "registry book" (grass records on top), 贯(guàn) strings or "connects" you to your family roots-together they trace your origins.
