# **舍不得 (shě bù dé) - Reluctant to part with; cannot bear to**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 舍 (shě): "to give up; to abandon." Radical: 舌 (shé, tongue) at the bottom, 宀 (mián, roof) at the top-suggesting "to let go/leave from under a roof."  
- 不 (bù): "not." A single stroke on the top, with 一 (yī, one) and a cross below-used for negation.  
- 得 (dé): "to get; to obtain." 彳 (chì, step) on the left, and 旦 (dàn, dawn/sunrise) on the right-suggesting obtaining something with effort.

**Examples**:  
- 我舍不得离开这里。(Wǒ shě bù dé líkāi zhèlǐ.) - I cannot bear to leave here.  
- 她舍不得扔掉那只旧玩具。(Tā shě bù dé rēngdiào nà zhī jiù wánjù.) - She is reluctant to throw away that old toy.  
- 父母舍不得孩子去外地。(Fùmǔ shě bù dé háizi qù wàidì.) - Parents can't bear for their children to go to another place.

**Usage Notes**:  
舍不得 (shě bù dé) is commonly used for emotional attachment to people, things, or memories. It usually precedes a verb (e.g., 舍不得( shě bù dé )+ 离开( líkāi ), 放手( fàngshǒu )).

**Memory Aids**:  
Picture someone under a roof (舍(shě)) who cannot (不(bù)) obtain the courage (得(dé)) to leave or let go.  
Try: "舍(shě) cannot (不(bù)) get (得(dé)) away!"
