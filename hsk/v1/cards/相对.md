# **相对 (xiāng duì) - relative; comparatively; opposite**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **相** (xiāng): Left side is "木" (mù, wood), right side is "目" (mù, eye). Originally shows someone inspecting with eyes-now means "each other," "mutual," or "appearance."  
- **对** (duì): Left is "又" (yòu, right hand), right is "寸" (cùn, inch/hand). Together suggesting "holding hands"-means "to face," "correct," or "pair."

**Examples**:  
- 这个价格相对便宜。 (zhè ge jiàgé xiāngduì piányi.) - This price is relatively cheap.  
- 他们的观点相对立。 (tāmen de guāndiǎn xiāng duìlì.) - Their opinions are opposed.  
- 相对来说，这份工作比较轻松。 (xiāngduì lái shuō, zhè fèn gōngzuò bǐjiào qīngsōng.) - Relatively speaking, this job is easier.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **相对** (xiāngduì) often means "relatively" when placed before adjectives.  
- Can also mean "opposite" or "to face each other" depending on context.

**Memory Aids**:  
- **相** (xiāng) “mutual eyes,” **对** (duì) “facing hands”-two facing each other = "relative" or "opposite."
