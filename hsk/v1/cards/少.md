# **少 (shǎo) - few; little; less**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 少 (shǎo): At the top are two small strokes (dots), symbolizing "few," and at the bottom is a sweeping hook, conveying "smallness" or "lack." The radical is 小 (xiǎo, "small") modified with extra strokes to emphasize "fewness."

**Examples**:  
- 人太少了。(Rén tài shǎo le.) - There are too few people.  
- 请少放盐。(Qǐng shǎo fàng yán.) - Please put less salt.  
- 我的钱很少。(Wǒ de qián hěn shǎo.) - I have very little money.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 少 (shǎo) is often used before nouns to mean "few/little" and as a verb meaning "to lack."  
- With adverbs: 太 (tài, "too"), 很 (hěn, "very").  
- Opposite: 多 (duō, "many/much").

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine the two dots as a couple of falling leaves-just a few, not many.  
- 少 (shǎo) sounds like "shallow"-if something is shallow, there’s less of it!
