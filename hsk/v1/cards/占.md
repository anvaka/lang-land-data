# **占 (zhàn) - to occupy, to take (up), to hold**

**Character Breakdown**:  
占 (zhàn): Left side is 口 (kǒu - mouth), right side is 占 (zhàn) itself, which originally depicts divination tools over a mouth, symbolizing speaking or declaring what will "take up" space or position.

**Examples**:  
- 他占(zhàn)了一个好位置。(Tā zhàn le yī gè hǎo wèizhì.) - He occupied a good spot.  
- 这个问题占(zhàn)用了很多时间。(Zhè gè wèntí zhàn yòng le hěn duō shíjiān.) - This issue took up a lot of time.  
- 不要随便占(zhàn)别人座位。(Bùyào suíbiàn zhàn biérén zuòwèi.) - Don't occupy others' seats at will.

**Usage Notes**:  
占 (zhàn) is commonly used to talk about occupying space, position, or resources. Can combine with nouns: 占(zhàn)位(zhì) (occupy seat), 占(zhàn)有(yǒu) (possess), etc.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine a 口 (kǒu - mouth) "taking up" or "occupying" space-it can't speak if something "occupies" it!  
Or, think of declaring (via mouth) that a spot is yours: "I occupy this!"
