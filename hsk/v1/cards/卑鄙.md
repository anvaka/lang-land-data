# **卑鄙 (bēi bǐ) - Despicable / Mean**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 卑 (bēi): low, humble. Radical: 十 (shí, “ten”) on the top, bottom is a simplified variant of 丿 (piě, “slash”) + another 十 (shí). Together, conveys "low" or "base."  
- 鄙 (bǐ): vulgar, mean. Left: 阝(fù, "mound", right-side ear radical). Right: 啇 (dí), complex component meaning “to observe," but here represents sound. Means "coarse, contemptible."

**Examples**:  
- 他( tā )的( de )行为( xíng wéi )很( hěn )卑鄙( bēi bǐ )。( tā de xíng wéi hěn bēi bǐ ) - His behavior is despicable.  
- 卑鄙( bēi bǐ )的( de )手段( shǒu duàn )让( ràng )人( rén )讨厌( tǎo yàn )。( bēi bǐ de shǒu duàn ràng rén tǎo yàn ) - Despicable tactics make people dislike him.  
- 我们( wǒ men )不( bù )应( yīng )该( gāi )用( yòng )卑鄙( bēi bǐ )的( de )方法( fāng fǎ )。( wǒ men bù yīng gāi yòng bēi bǐ de fāng fǎ ) - We shouldn’t use mean methods.

**Usage Notes**:  
卑鄙( bēi bǐ ) is usually a strong negative, describing actions, words, or people that are morally contemptible. Not used for casual or mild criticism.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 卑( bēi ), "low," + 鄙( bǐ ), "vulgar": "Low and vulgar means despicable." Or, "卑( bēi )" is beneath ("bottom" character), "鄙( bǐ )" sounds like "be!"-so "be low" = despicable.
