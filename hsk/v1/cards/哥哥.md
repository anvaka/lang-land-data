# **哥哥 (gēge) - older brother**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 哥 (gē): "Older brother." The character shows two 口 (kǒu, mouth) stacked vertically, hinting at calling/addressing someone.  
- 哥 (gē): Repeated for emphasis or affection in Chinese kinship terms.

**Examples**:  
- 我有一个哥哥 (Wǒ yǒu yí gè gēge) - I have an older brother.  
- 哥哥喜欢打篮球 (Gēge xǐhuān dǎ lánqiú) - Older brother likes playing basketball.  
- 哥哥在看书 (Gēge zài kàn shū) - Older brother is reading.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 哥哥 (gēge) refers specifically to a male sibling older than the speaker, not just any male. Used primarily in family or close circles.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Picture two "mouths" (口, kǒu) stacked as brothers talking-double "mouth" = older brother.  
- Doubling 哥 (gē) = someone familiar and close, like an elder brother.
