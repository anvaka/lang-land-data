# **南 (nán) - south**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 南 (nán): Means “south.” The character shows a musical instrument below, with "十" (shí, ten) on top. The “十” (shí, top) radical gives the clue to its components, but the whole character is now purely phonetic and semantic. No strict radical, but "十" (shí) commonly recognized.

**Examples**:  
- 我住在南方。(Wǒ zhù zài nán fāng.) - I live in the south.  
- 南风很暖。(Nán fēng hěn nuǎn.) - The south wind is warm.  
- 火车往南开。(Huǒ chē wǎng nán kāi.) - The train heads south.

**Usage Notes**:  
南 (nán) can be used for directions or places (e.g., 南方 (nán fāng) - southern regions); pairs with 北 (běi, north).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of "南" (nán) as a compass pointing down (to the south), and the character visually looks “balanced” like the lower half of a map pointing downward.
