# **多余 (duōyú) - surplus, unnecessary, extra**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 多 (duō): "many," "much." Top = two characters for evening (夕 xī); suggests abundance.  
- 余 (yú): "surplus," "remain." Top = 亻(human radical, left); bottom = 舁 (yú, to lift). Implies something left after needs are met.

**Examples**:

- 我不需要多余的信息。 (Wǒ bù xūyào duōyú de xìnxī.) - I don’t need extra information.

**Usage Notes**:  
多余 (duōyú) is often used to describe things, words, or actions that are unnecessary or superfluous. Common in both spoken and written Chinese.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine "many" (多 duō) things "remain" (余 yú) after you’ve taken what you need-those are the surplus or extra things.
