# **参考 (cān kǎo) - to refer to; reference; consult**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **参** (cān): Top = "⺮" (bamboo), middle = "厶" (private), bottom = "大" (big). Originally means "to join/participate." Here, refers to "consulting" or "referring."  
- **考** (kǎo): Top = "老" (old), bottom = "丂" (breath). Means "to examine/test." Indicates looking carefully.

**Examples**:  
- 请( qǐng ) 参考( cān kǎo ) 这本书( zhè běn shū )。 (Qǐng cān kǎo zhè běn shū.) - Please refer to this book.  
- 我们( wǒ men ) 需要( xū yào ) 参考( cān kǎo ) 其他( qí tā ) 资料( zī liào )。 (Wǒmen xūyào cān kǎo qítā zīliào.) - We need to consult other materials.

**Usage Notes**:  
- Commonly used as both a noun (参考 cān kǎo材料 cáiliào = reference material) and verb (做 zuò参考 cān kǎo = make a reference).  
- Often used in academic, work, and informational contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think of “参” (cān) as “joining in/looking at,” and “考” (kǎo) as “examining.” When you 参考 (cān kǎo), you "join to examine," i.e., consult or refer to something.
