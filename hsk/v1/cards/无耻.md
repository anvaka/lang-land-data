# **无耻 (wú chǐ) - Shameless**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **无 (wú)**: “Not; without.” The radical is "一 (yī)" (one) at the top, and "丨 (gǔn)" (line) inside, with a "儿 (ér)" (son/legs) at the bottom.  
- **耻 (chǐ)**: “Shame; disgrace.” Left side is the "耳 (ěr)" (ear) radical; right side is "止 (zhǐ)" (stop).

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 真 (zhēn) 无耻 (wú chǐ)。 (He is truly shameless.)  
- 她 (tā) 竟然 (jìng rán) 无耻 (wú chǐ) 地 (de) 撒谎 (sā huǎng)。 (She actually lied shamelessly.)  
- 这种 (zhè zhǒng) 行为 (xíng wéi) 很 (hěn) 无耻 (wú chǐ)。 (This kind of behavior is very shameless.)

**Usage Notes**:  
无耻 (wú chǐ) is often used as an insult, to strongly criticize someone’s lack of morals or decency. Used in spoken and written Chinese, mainly in negative contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
无 (wú) means “without,” and 耻 (chǐ) means “shame”-so 无耻 (wú chǐ) is literally “without shame.” Picture someone literally leaving their “耳 (ěr)” (ears) and “止 (zhǐ)” (stops) behind-ignoring what they hear and never stopping at what’s right or wrong!
