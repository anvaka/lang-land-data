# **自己 (zìjǐ) - oneself, self**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **自** (zì): Means "self." Pictograph of a nose (in ancient times, the nose represented oneself). The main stroke is at the **top** half, with a stroke resembling a nose pointing **downward**.  
- **己** (jǐ): Means "self" or "oneself." The character looks like a bent form, representing a person. The main curve is in the **bottom** half.

**Examples**:  
- 我自己 (wǒ zìjǐ) - myself  
- 她自己做饭 (tā zìjǐ zuò fàn) - She cooks by herself.  
- 你相信自己 (nǐ xiāngxìn zìjǐ) - Believe in yourself.

**Usage Notes**:  
自己 (zìjǐ) refers to oneself and is often used for emphasis. It can follow any pronoun or noun: 他自己 (tā zìjǐ), 学生自己 (xuéshēng zìjǐ). Pronouns are sometimes dropped if context is clear.

**Memory Aids**:  
"自" (zì) is like pointing to your own nose (= yourself). "己" (jǐ) looks like a person bent inward, emphasizing "self." Together,  自己 (zìjǐ) is "pointing back to yourself."
