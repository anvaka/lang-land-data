# **淡水 (dànshuǐ) - Fresh water**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **淡** (dàn): "mild," "light" (in flavor/color). Left: "氵" (shuǐ, water) radical indicates a relation to water. Right: "炎" (yán) suggests "flame/heat," but here it adds sound, not meaning.  
- **水** (shuǐ): "water." Pictograph of flowing water with three drops. Whole character.

**Examples**:  
- 淡水鱼 (dànshuǐ yú) - Freshwater fish  
- 这里有很多淡水湖。(Zhèlǐ yǒu hěn duō dànshuǐ hú.) - There are many freshwater lakes here.  
- 淡水比海水容易喝。(Dànshuǐ bǐ hǎishuǐ róngyì hē.) - Fresh water is easier to drink than seawater.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 淡水 (dànshuǐ) refers to non-salty water from rivers, lakes, or ponds (not the sea). Used in science and everyday life.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 淡 (dàn): Imagine water (氵) mixed with a little "flame" (炎) becomes mild, not strong-like "fresh" water, not salty.  
- 淡水 (dànshuǐ): "淡" (dàn, bland) + "水" (shuǐ, water) = "bland water," i.e., water without salt-fresh water!
