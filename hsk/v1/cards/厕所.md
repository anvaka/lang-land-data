# **厕所 (cè suǒ) - Toilet / Restroom**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **厕** (cè): Left = 厂 (chǎng, "cliff"); right = 则 (zé, related to "rule" or "standard"). Historically means "toilet", "latrine".  
- **所** (suǒ): Left = 户 (hù, "door" or "house"); right = 斤 (jīn, "axe"). Often used as a suffix for places.

**Examples**:  
- 请问厕所在哪里？(qǐng wèn cè suǒ zài nǎ lǐ?) - Excuse me, where is the restroom?  
- 他去厕所了。(tā qù cè suǒ le.) - He went to the bathroom.  
- 厕所很干净。(cè suǒ hěn gān jìng.) - The restroom is very clean.

**Usage Notes**:  
**厕所** (cè suǒ) is a neutral term for public toilets. For polite context, use **卫生间** (wèi shēng jiān). In spoken Chinese, **洗手间** (xǐ shǒu jiān) is also common.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine entering (户 hù, "door") a "cliff" (厂 chǎng) for a private moment-"ce-so" like "sew", as in "sew it up," links to a place you go in private.
