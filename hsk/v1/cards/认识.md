# **认识 (rènshi) - to know; to recognize; to be acquainted with**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 认 (rèn): Left side is 讠(yán, "speech" radical) and right side is 人(rén, "person"). Relates to recognizing or identifying through speech.  
- 识 (shi): Left side is 讠(yán, "speech" radical) and right side is 只(zhī, "only"), suggesting distinguishing by words or acknowledgment.

**Examples**:  
- 我(wǒ)认识(rènshi)你(nǐ)。 (Wǒ rènshi nǐ.) - I know you.  
- 你(nǐ)认识(rènshi)他(tā)吗(ma)？ (Nǐ rènshi tā ma?) - Do you know him?  
- 很(hěn)高兴(gāoxìng)认识(rènshi)你(nǐ)。 (Hěn gāoxìng rènshi nǐ.) - Nice to meet you.

**Usage Notes**:  
认识(rènshi) is used for "knowing" people or recognizing things, not for deep knowledge (use 知道(zhīdào) or 懂(dǒng) for "know information").

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 认(rèn) (speech + person) as "recognizing a person by talk." 识(shí) (speech + only) is "identifying only by speech." Combined: meeting and knowing someone through words.
