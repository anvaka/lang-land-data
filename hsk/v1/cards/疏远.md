# **疏远 (shūyuǎn) - To alienate, become distant**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **疏 (shū)**: "distant, sparse, neglect." Left: "氵(water radical, left side)" + Right: "疏" (phonetic, meaning spreading apart).  
- **远 (yuǎn)**: "far, distant." Left: "辶(walk radical, bottom/left)" + Right: "元" (head/top, meaning origin).

**Examples**:  
- 他们渐渐疏远了。(Tāmen jiànjiàn shūyuǎn le.) - They gradually became distant.  
- 疏远朋友会让你感到孤独。(Shūyuǎn péngyǒu huì ràng nǐ gǎndào gūdú.) - Alienating friends can make you feel lonely.  
- 工作太忙让他和家人疏远了。(Gōngzuò tài máng ràng tā hé jiārén shūyuǎn le.) - Being too busy at work made him grow distant from his family.

**Usage Notes**:  
"疏远 (shūyuǎn)" is usually used with people, describing relationships becoming less close. Can be active ("to alienate") or passive ("to grow apart").

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: When "water (氵, shuǐ)" flows between people, distance "远 (yuǎn)" is created-疏远 (shūyuǎn) means becoming emotionally distant.
