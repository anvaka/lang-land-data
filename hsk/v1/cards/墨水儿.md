# **墨水儿 (mò shuǐr) - Ink**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **墨** (mò): "Ink." Top: **黑** (hēi - black); bottom: **土** (tǔ - earth/soil); together refers to black pigment made from soot and earth.  
- **水** (shuǐ): "Water." Central vertical line splitting two side drops, resembles flowing water.  
- **儿** (r): Suffix; written as two legs below, used in Northern Mandarin for retroflexion (the "er" sound).

**Examples**:  
- 我买了一瓶墨水儿。(Wǒ mǎi le yī píng mò shuǐr.) - I bought a bottle of ink.  
- 你的墨水儿用完了。(Nǐ de mò shuǐr yòng wán le.) - Your ink is used up.  
- 请借我点墨水儿。(Qǐng jiè wǒ diǎn mò shuǐr.) - Please lend me some ink.

**Usage Notes**:  
"墨水儿" (mò shuǐr) is common in colloquial northern Mandarin. "墨水" (mò shuǐ) without "儿" (r) is standard elsewhere. Refers specifically to writing/drawing ink, not printer ink (which is 墨盒 (mò hé)).

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine "墨" (mò) is black earth (soil under blackness), and "水" (shuǐ) is water-together, muddy black water = ink! "儿" (r) at the end just gives it a playful Beijing twist.
