# **正负 (zhèng fù) - positive and negative; plus and minus**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **正** (zhèng): right, positive, correct; composed of 一(yī, "one") on top and 止(zhǐ, "stop") below, suggesting "upright" or "just right."  
- **负** (fù): negative, to bear; left side is 贝(bèi, "shell," ancient currency), right side is 父(fù, "father") on top, symbolizing "to bear a burden" (originally meaning "to carry").

**Examples**:  
- 结果有正负两种。(Jiéguǒ yǒu zhèng fù liǎng zhǒng.) - There are two possible results: positive and negative.  
- 这个数的正负是多少？(Zhège shù de zhèng fù shì duōshǎo?) - What is the sign (positive/negative) of this number?  
- 检查电池的正负极。(Jiǎnchá diànchí de zhèng fù jí.) - Check the positive and negative terminals of the battery.

**Usage Notes**:  
**正负** (zhèng fù) is often used in mathematics, science, and electronics to describe opposites (like plus/minus, positive/negative). The word can describe directions, results, numbers, or charges.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think "**正** (zhèng) = upright/right" (like a "+"), "**负** (fù) = to bear/a burden" (as in trouble or a "−")-together, they balance each other, just like plus and minus.
