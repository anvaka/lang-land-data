# **揭露 (jiē lù) - expose; reveal**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 揭 (jiē):
  - Left: 扌 (shǒu), the "hand" radical, indicating an action.
  - Right: 曷 (hé), phonetically contributes but originally means "what; why."
  - Overall: Often relates to lifting or disclosing with one's hand.  
- 露 (lù):
  - Top: 雨 (yǔ), "rain," suggesting wetness or exposure.
  - Bottom: 路 (lù), "road," but in this case serves as a sound component.
  - Overall: Means to reveal or expose (as things appear after rain).

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 揭露 (jiē lù) 了 (le) 真相 (zhēn xiàng)。 (Tā jiēlù le zhēnxiàng.) - He exposed the truth.  
- 媒体 (méi tǐ) 揭露 (jiē lù) 了 (le) 丑闻 (chǒu wén)。 (Méi tǐ jiēlù le chǒuwén.) - The media revealed the scandal.  
- 他的 (tā de) 谎言 (huǎng yán) 被 (bèi) 揭露 (jiē lù) 了 (le)。 (Tā de huǎngyán bèi jiēlù le.) - His lies were exposed.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 揭露 (jiē lù) is formal; often used in news or official contexts.  
- Commonly refers to exposing secrets, wrongdoings, or hidden facts.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think: A "hand" (扌, shǒu) 揭 (jiē) "lifts" a cover to "expose" what's beneath, and after the "rain" (雨, yǔ), everything is "exposed" (露, lù) and visible.
