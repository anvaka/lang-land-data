# **外公 (wàigōng) - Maternal grandfather**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 外 (wài) - outside; the left side is 夕 (xī, evening) on top and 卜 (bǔ, divination) on the bottom-right.  
- 公 (gōng) - elder male, public;  八 (bā, eight) is on top and 厶 (sī, private) is on the bottom-left.

**Examples**:  
- 我的外公很喜欢钓鱼。(Wǒ de wàigōng hěn xǐhuān diàoyú.) - My maternal grandfather likes fishing.  
- 外公每天早上散步。(Wàigōng měitiān zǎoshang sànbù.) - Maternal grandpa takes a walk every morning.  
- 我暑假常常去外公家。(Wǒ shǔjià chángcháng qù wàigōng jiā.) - I often go to my maternal grandfather’s house during summer vacation.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 外公 (wàigōng) refers only to your mother's father.  
- “外”(wài) here means "maternal side"; “公”(gōng) is a respectful term for an elder man.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think “外”(wài) = outside (your father’s immediate family) + “公”(gōng) = grandpa. So, 外公(wàigōng) is your “outside-grandpa” - your mother’s father.
