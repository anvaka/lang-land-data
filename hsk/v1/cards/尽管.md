# **尽管 (jǐn guǎn) - Even though; although; feel free (to)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **尽 (jǐn)**: to the utmost, to use up. Left: 尽 (jǐn) has the radical 尸 (shī, "corpse") on top, representing something used up; bottom component is 又 (yòu, "again" or "hand").  
- **管 (guǎn)**: manage, pipe. Top: ⺮ (zhú, "bamboo") radical, common in objects made from bamboo; bottom: 官 (guān, "official"), suggesting management.

**Examples**:  
- 尽管 (jǐn guǎn) 下雨，我们还是去散步。(Wǒmen háishi qù sànbù.) - Even though it rained, we still went for a walk.  
- 你有问题尽管 (jǐn guǎn) 问。(Nǐ yǒu wèntí jǐn guǎn wèn.) - If you have questions, feel free to ask.  
- 尽管 (jǐn guǎn) 很难，他坚持下来了。(Jǐn guǎn hěn nán, tā jiānchí xiàlái le.) - Although it was difficult, he persisted.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 尽管 (jǐn guǎn) as conjunction = "although/even though," often paired with 但是 (dànshì, "but").  
- As an adverb = "feel free (to)."  
- Use at the start of a clause.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 尽 (jǐn) (use up) + 管 (guǎn) (manage/control) = "use all your control," so "even though" or "just go ahead."  
- Imagine "尽 (jǐn)" as giving all, and "管 (guǎn)" as managing without worry-thus, "尽管 (jǐn guǎn)" = go ahead despite concerns.
