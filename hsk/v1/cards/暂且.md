# **暂且 (zànqiě) - For the time being; temporarily**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **暂 (zàn)**: "temporary." Left: "日 (rì)" (sun) suggesting time/day; right: "斩 (zhǎn)" (cut)-thus, "cut-off time" or temporary.  
- **且 (qiě)**: "for the time being," "moreover." Top: "一 (yī)" (one); below: repeating "月 (yuè)" (moon/month), often conveying sequence or continuation.

**Examples**:  
- 我们暂且(zànqiě)休息一下。(Wǒmen zànqiě xiūxi yīxià.) - Let's rest for now.  
- 这件事暂且(zànqiě)不讨论。(Zhè jiàn shì zànqiě bù tǎolùn.) - We'll not discuss this matter for the time being.  
- 你可以暂且(zànqiě)用我的手机。(Nǐ kěyǐ zànqiě yòng wǒ de shǒujī.) - You can use my phone temporarily.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **暂且 (zànqiě)** is typically used before verbs to mean "for now" or "temporarily." It's often paired with a suggested pause or deferral.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think "**暂 (zàn)**": "sun cut" - day/time that is cut short = temporary.  
- "**且 (qiě)**" looks like stacked calendars (one on top of months): things being put off one after another, so "for now."
