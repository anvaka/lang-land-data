# **例外 (lìwài) - Exception**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 例 (lì): Means "example". Left side is 亻 (rén) "person", right side is 列 (liè) "row/line". Together, think: "a person among a line" = an example.  
- 外 (wài): Means "outside". Top is 夕 (xī) "evening", bottom-right is 卜 (bǔ) "divine/predict". Suggests something beyond or outside.

**Examples**:  
- 这次没有例外。(Zhè cì méiyǒu lìwài.) - There is no exception this time.  
- 每个规则都有例外。(Měi gè guīzé dōu yǒu lìwài.) - Every rule has an exception.  
- 他是个例外。(Tā shì gè lìwài.) - He is an exception.

**Usage Notes**:  
例外 (lìwài) is often used as a noun or after verbs (e.g., "A 除外" (chúwài) = except A). Common in formal and conversational contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "Example (例/lì) outside (外/wài) the rule" = Exception.  
**Tip:** 例 (lì) = example, 外 (wài) = outside → "example outside [the usual]".
