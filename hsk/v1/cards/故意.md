# **故意 (gù yì) - Intentionally; on purpose**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **故** (gù): "reason; cause; intentionally". On the left is the **古** (gǔ, "old") radical, on the right is **攵** (pū, "to tap" - often related to actions) on the right.  
- **意** (yì): "idea; thought; intention". Top is **音** (yīn, "sound"), bottom is **心** (xīn, "heart").

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 是 (shì) 故意 (gù yì) 的 (de)。 (tā shì gù yì de.) - He did it on purpose.  
- 她 (tā) 故意 (gù yì) 迟到 (chí dào)。 (tā gù yì chí dào.) - She was intentionally late.  
- 你 (nǐ) 不是 (bù shì) 故意 (gù yì) 的 (de) 吧 (ba)？ (nǐ bù shì gù yì de ba?) - You didn't do it on purpose, did you?

**Usage Notes**:  
- 故意 (gù yì) is an adverb, placed before verbs to show deliberate action.  
- Often used to emphasize an action was NOT an accident.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 故 (gù, "old reason") + 意 (yì, "idea/intent") = "old intention" → doing with full intention.  
- Imagine holding an "old idea" (故gù + 意yì) firmly and acting on it on purpose!
