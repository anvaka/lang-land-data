# **发生 (fāshēng) - to happen; to occur**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 发 (fā): "to send out", "to emit".
  - Left: "又 (yòu)" means "again".
  - Right/top: "⺈ (dāo)" knife radical (upper-right position) adds action sense.  
- 生 (shēng): "to be born", "to arise".
  - Top: "一 (yī)" a line.
  - Middle: "丨 (gǔn)" vertical line.
  - Bottom: "丷 (bā)" small strokes.
  - Together, represents sprouting/growing.

**Examples**:  
- 昨天发生了什么？(Zuótiān fāshēng le shénme?) - What happened yesterday?  
- 地震发生在晚上。(Dìzhèn fāshēng zài wǎnshang.) - The earthquake happened at night.  
- 这种情况很少发生。(Zhè zhǒng qíngkuàng hěn shǎo fāshēng.) - This kind of situation rarely occurs.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 发生 (fāshēng) is used for events (often negative or unexpected) happening, not for planned actions.  
- Usually followed by nouns indicating events: 事故 (shìgù, accident), 变化 (biànhuà, change).

**Memory Aids**:  
- 发 (fā) is like "firing" something out; 生 (shēng) means "to be born"-when something is fired out and born, it "happens".
