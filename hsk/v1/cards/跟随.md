# **跟随 (gēnsuí) - to follow**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **跟** (gēn): "to follow"; left is 足 (zú, foot) radical, right is 艮 (gèn, stubborn/stop). Shows foot movement, relating to following/moving.  
- **随** (suí): "to follow along"; left is 阝 (fù, mound/city, on the left), right is 隹 (zhuī, short-tailed bird). Originally implied movement or following a path.

**Examples**:  
- 请跟随我。(Qǐng gēnsuí wǒ.) - Please follow me.  
- 孩子们跟随老师进教室。(Háizimen gēnsuí lǎoshī jìn jiàoshì.) - The children follow the teacher into the classroom.  
- 他习惯跟随潮流。(Tā xíguàn gēnsuí cháoliú.) - He is used to following trends.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 跟随(gēnsuí) is more formal than 跟着(gēnzhe); used for literal and metaphorical following (people, ideas, trends).  
- Can be used as verb or in verb-object phrases.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 跟(gēn): Think of "feet" (足zú) following someone.  
- 随(suí): Imagine a bird (隹zhuī) beside a city wall (阝fù), always moving along its path-just like you follow someone.
