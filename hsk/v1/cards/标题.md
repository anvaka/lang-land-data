**Character Breakdown**:  
- **标 (biāo)**: means "mark," "sign," or "label." Left: "木 (mù)" radical (tree/wood) on the left; right: "票 (piào)" component (ticket/vote) on the right.  
- **题 (tí)**: means "topic," "subject," or "title." Top: "⻌ (chuò)" swoosh (walk/movement); bottom right: "是 (shì)" meaning "is/yes"; bottom left: "页 (yè)" (page component).

**Examples**:  
- 请写下文章的标题。(Qǐng xiě xià wénzhāng de biāotí.) - Please write the title of the article.

- 你能看清楚标题吗？(Nǐ néng kàn qīngchu biāotí ma?) - Can you see the title clearly?

**Usage Notes**:

**Memory Aids**:  
- 标 (biāo): Think of a "wooden (木 mù) sign/ticket (票 piào)" marking the spot.  
- 题 (tí): Imagine a "topic (题 tí)" on the "page (页 yè)" you need to walk (⻌ chuò) toward to read.
