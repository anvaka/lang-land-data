# **衔接 (xiánjiē) - To connect; to link**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 衔 (xián): means "to hold in the mouth," often found in formal words. The radical "行" (xíng) is on the left (suggesting action/movement), with "钅" (jīn, metal) formerly on the right as a phonetic/semantic component.  
- 接 (jiē): means "to receive; to connect." The left is "扌" (shǒu, hand) radical, indicating an action done by hand; the right is "妾" (qiè), used phonetically.

**Examples**:  
- 这两个部分需要衔接。(Zhè liǎng gè bùfen xūyào xiánjiē.) - These two parts need to be connected.  
- 课程内容要衔接好。(Kèchéng nèiróng yào xiánjiē hǎo.) - The course content needs to be linked well.  
- 衔接上下文很重要。(Xiánjiē shàngxiàwén hěn zhòngyào.) - Linking the context is very important.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 衔接 (xiánjiē) is often used for linking ideas, sequences, processes, or physical parts, emphasizing smooth or logical continuity.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think of 衔 (xián) as "holding" and 接 (jiē) as "connecting by hand"-so "holding and linking" things together.
