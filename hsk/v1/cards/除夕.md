# **除夕 (chúxī) - Chinese New Year's Eve**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **除 (chú)**: "Remove; eliminate." Left: "阝" (fù) - city wall radical, right: "余" (yú) - surplus.  
- **夕 (xī)**: "Evening." Top: two short strokes, bottom: "夕" pictographs a crescent moon, symbolizing nighttime.

**Examples**:  
- 我们在除夕 (wǒmen zài chúxī) 吃年夜饭 (chī nián yè fàn)。 (We eat New Year's Eve dinner on Chinese New Year's Eve.)  
- 除夕 (chúxī) 的晚上 (de wǎnshang)，大家守岁 (dàjiā shǒusuì)。 (On Chinese New Year's Eve night, everyone stays up late.)  
- 除夕 (chúxī) 是家人团聚 (shì jiārén tuánjù) 的日子 (de rìzi)。 (Chinese New Year's Eve is a day for family reunions.)

**Usage Notes**:  
除夕 (chúxī) refers specifically to the night before the Lunar New Year, different from Western New Year's Eve. Often paired with customs like eating 年夜饭 (nián yè fàn, reunion dinner), 放鞭炮 (fàng biānpào, setting off fireworks), and 守岁 (shǒu suì, staying up late).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of **除 (chú)** as "removing" the old year, and **夕 (xī)** as "evening," so 除夕 (chúxī) is the evening that removes the old year!
