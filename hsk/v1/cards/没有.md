  - Meaning: "not," "without"  
- **有 (yǒu)**
  - Top: 𠂇 (gǎn) hand component
  - Bottom: 月 (yuè) moon/flesh
  - Meaning: "have," "there is/are"

**Examples**:

**Usage Notes**:  
Use 没有 (méiyǒu) to negate "to have" (有 yǒu), or to say "there isn’t." For verbs (actions), use 没 (méi) before the verb to show something didn't happen (e.g., 没去 (méi qù): didn’t go).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "没 (méi)"-like water washing something away, and "有 (yǒu)"-to possess. Together: "Not possess" = "don't have."
