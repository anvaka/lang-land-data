# **容纳 (róng nà) - to hold; to accommodate**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **容 (róng)**: to contain; appearance. Top: "宀 (mián)" meaning "roof," bottom: "谷 (gǔ)" meaning "valley," suggesting space under a roof-something that can contain.  
- **纳 (nà)**: to receive; to accept. Left: "纟(sī)" silk radical, right: "内 (nèi)" meaning "inside," suggesting bringing something (like thread) inside.

- Usually takes a direct object (what is being accommodated).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a "roof (宀 mián)" over a "valley (谷 gǔ)" to picture containing space (**容 róng**).  
- Think of "thread (纟 sī)" going "inside (内 nèi)" a container to accept and include things (**纳 nà**).
