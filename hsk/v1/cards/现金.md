# **现金 (xiàn jīn) - cash**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **现 (xiàn)**: means "present, current". Left side is 玨(yù), related to jade, right side is 见(jiàn), "to see" (eye 目(mù) on top, person 儿(ér) at bottom). The idea is "see at present".  
- **金 (jīn)**: means "metal, gold". Top is two dots (representing metal pieces) over the radical 钅(jīn, metal) at the left and the component 王(wáng, king) at the right, symbolizing something precious.

**Examples**:  
- 请用现金支付。(Qǐng yòng xiànjīn zhīfù.) - Please pay with cash.  
- 这里不收现金。(Zhèlǐ bù shōu xiànjīn.) - Cash is not accepted here.  
- 他身上没有现金。(Tā shēnshang méiyǒu xiànjīn.) - He doesn't have cash on him.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 现金 (xiànjīn) is a noun and refers only to physical money (bills and coins), not electronic payments or credit.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 现 (xiàn) = "see" (见(jiàn)) what is "present",  
金 (jīn) = "gold" = "money", so 现金 (xiànjīn) = "cash (visible money)".
