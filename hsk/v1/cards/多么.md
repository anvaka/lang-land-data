# **多么 (duōme) - How; What (exclamation)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **多 (duō)**: "many/much." The top part is two "夕 (xī)" ("night; evening"), signifying "a lot" stacked together.  
- **么 (me)**: "interrogative particle" used in suffixes; component with **丿 (piě)** stroke on left and "小 (xiǎo)" at the bottom, giving a questioning tone.

**Examples**:  
- 你( nǐ) 多么(duōme) 聪明(cōngming)! - How smart you are!  
- 天气(tiānqì) 多么(duōme) 好(hǎo) 啊(a)! - How nice the weather is!  
- 他(tā) 多么(duōme) 希望(xīwàng) 去(qù) 中国(zhōngguó)。- How he wishes to go to China.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 多么(duōme) is used before adjectives/adverbs to express exclamation: "how..."  
- Common in both spoken and written Chinese, especially in emotional contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine "多 (duō)" = "many/much" and "么 (me)" often asks "what/kind"-so together, you’re saying "how much" or "to what degree" something is!  
- If something is so intense you want to exclaim, think "多 (duō)" (so much!) + "么 (me)" (how!) = 多么(duōme)!
