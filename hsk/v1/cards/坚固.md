# **坚固 (jiān gù) - Strong; Sturdy; Firm**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **坚 (jiān)**: Left-“石 (shí)” [stone radical], right-“同 (tóng)” but simplified above “又 (yòu)” [again/hand]. Means "hard, firm".  
- **固 (gù)**: Outside-“囗 (wéi)” [enclosure radical], inside-“古 (gǔ)” [ancient]. Means "solid; stable".

**Examples**:  
- 这座桥很坚固。(Zhè zuò qiáo hěn jiān gù.) - This bridge is very sturdy.  
- 墙壁必须坚固。(Qiáng bì bì xū jiān gù.) - The walls must be strong.  
- 他的意志非常坚固。(Tā de yì zhì fēi cháng jiān gù.) - His willpower is very firm.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **坚固 (jiān gù)** is often used for physical objects (bridges, walls) and can also describe abstract things (beliefs, relationships).  
- Placed before nouns or after "很 (hěn)", "非常 (fēi cháng)" for emphasis.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think of "石 (shí)" (stone) makes things "坚 (jiān)" (hard), and being "固 (gù)" (enclosed ancient) means something won’t fall apart-so **坚固 (jiān gù)** is rock-solid.
