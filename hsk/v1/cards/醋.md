# **醋 (cù) - vinegar**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 醋 (cù):
  - Left: 酉 (yǒu) - "wine jar"; radical often relates to alcohol or fermentation.
  - Right: 卒 (zú) - phonetically gives the "cù" sound; means "to die" or "soldier," but here it's for pronunciation.

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢吃醋。(Wǒ xǐhuān chī cù.) - I like eating vinegar.  
- 他吃醋了。(Tā chī cù le.) - He got jealous.  
- 请加点醋。(Qǐng jiā diǎn cù.) - Please add some vinegar.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 醋 (cù) literally means "vinegar", but can also mean "jealousy" (especially romantic jealousy) in colloquial speech, like 吃醋 (chī cù)-"to eat vinegar", meaning to be jealous.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 酉 (yǒu) + 卒 (zú): Imagine "wine" (酉 yǒu) aging until it "expires" (卒 zú), turning sour as vinegar (醋 cù).  
- Think: "‘Cù (醋)’ is the word you use when things get sour-either your food or your feelings!"
