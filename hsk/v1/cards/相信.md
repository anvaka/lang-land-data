# **相信 (xiāng xìn) - to believe; to trust**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **相 (xiāng)**: left-right. Left: "木 (mù)" (wood), right: "目 (mù)" (eye). Originally means "to look at," suggesting mutual observation.  
- **信 (xìn)**: left-right. Left: "亻 (rén)" (person radical), right: "言 (yán)" (speech). Implies a person’s words-hence, trust or letter.

**Examples**:  
- 我相信你。(Wǒ xiāng xìn nǐ.) - I believe you.  
- 她不相信谣言。(Tā bù xiāng xìn yáo yán.) - She does not believe rumors.  
- 请相信自己。(Qǐng xiāng xìn zì jǐ.) - Please believe in yourself.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **相信 (xiāng xìn)** often takes people, statements, or things as objects.  
- Used for trust/belief, not for religious "faith" (that’s 信仰 (xìn yǎng)).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Picture two people (相 (xiāng): wood & eye = observing each other) exchanging honest words (信 (xìn): a person speaks), so you believe or trust.
