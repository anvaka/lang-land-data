# **溅 (jiàn) - to splash; to spatter**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 溅 (jiàn):
  - Left: 氵(shuǐ) "water radical" - indicates meaning related to water
  - Right: 兼(jiān) - phonetic component, means “double; simultaneously”

**Examples**:  
- 水花溅到了我身上。(Shuǐ huā jiàn dào le wǒ shēn shang.) - Water splashed onto me.  
- 泥水溅了他一身。(Nǐ shuǐ jiàn le tā yī shēn.) - Mud splattered all over him.  
- 油溅出了锅外。(Yóu jiàn chū le guō wài.) - Oil splashed out of the pan.

**Usage Notes**:  
溅(jiàn) describes the action of small drops (water, mud, oil, etc.) scattering, often used with liquids and followed by a direction or target.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of the “water radical” 氵(shuǐ) on the left as drops, and imagine them spreading in different directions (like “double” 兼(jiān)) when something splashes.
