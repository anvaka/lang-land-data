# **书架 (shūjià) - Bookshelf**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 书 (shū): "Book." Consists of top "⺮" (zhú, meaning bamboo, referring to ancient bamboo slips for writing) and bottom "曰" (yuē, meaning to speak.)  
- 架 (jià): "Shelf" or "frame." Left: "木" (mù, wood). Right: "加" (jiā, to add), suggesting a structure added onto wood.

**Examples**:  
- 书架上有很多书。(shūjià shàng yǒu hěn duō shū.) - There are many books on the bookshelf.  
- 请把书放回书架。(qǐng bǎ shū fàng huí shūjià.) - Please put the book back on the bookshelf.  
- 这个书架很结实。(zhège shūjià hěn jiēshi.) - This bookshelf is very sturdy.

**Usage Notes**:  
书架 (shūjià) is a countable noun and often used with measure words like 个 (gè) or 架 (jià)-e.g., 一个书架 (yí gè shūjià).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 书 (shū, book) + 架 (jià, frame) = a "frame for books"-a bookshelf! The 木 (mù, wood) radical in 架 (jià) helps you remember shelves are often made of wood.
