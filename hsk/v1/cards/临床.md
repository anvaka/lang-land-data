# **临床 (lín chuáng) - Clinical**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **临 (lín)**: Means "to face" or "to approach." The radical on the left is "厂 (chǎng)" meaning "cliff," and on the right is "品 (pǐn)" or more commonly "臣 (chén)" meaning "minister/courtier," but here, it clarifies the action of facing toward something.  
- **床 (chuáng)**: Means "bed." Left side is the "木 (mù)" radical (wood), and the right is "广 (guǎng)" (a shelter or house component) on top of "丶 (diǎn)."
