# **云 (yún) - cloud**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **云** (yún):
  - Top: "二" (èr) - meaning "two", serves as a phonetic component here.
  - Bottom: "厶" (sī) - a component often seen in characters relating to private or winding shapes.
  - The character originally depicted the shape of clouds or mist in ancient scripts.

**Examples**:  
- 天上有很多云。(Tiān shàng yǒu hěn duō yún.) - There are many clouds in the sky.  
- 白云看起来像棉花。(Bái yún kàn qǐlái xiàng miánhuā.) - White clouds look like cotton.  
- 今天多云。(Jīntiān duō yún.) - Today is cloudy.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **云** (yún) is both a noun ("cloud/clouds") and an adjective in weather contexts ("cloudy" as in **多云** (duō yún)).  
- Used metaphorically for things that float or cluster, e.g., **云计算** (yún jìsuàn) - "cloud computing".

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine the two lines on top as layers of cloud, with the winding shape below as twisting mist.  
- The character's shape resembles wispy clouds in the sky.
