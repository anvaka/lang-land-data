**Character Breakdown**:  
- 区 (qū): "area; district." Left: ⺆ (fāng) radical meaning "box" or "enclosure." Right: “乂” (yì) meaning "govern" or "manage."  
- 域 (yù): "domain; territory." Left: 土 (tǔ, "earth" radical) indicating relation to land. Right: 或 (huò), meaning "perhaps," also used phonetically here.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 区域 (qūyù) is formal and used for large, defined spaces like administrative regions, functional zones, or even ecological regions.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 区 (qū): Picture a box (enclosure) with a manager in it-managing an area.  
- 域 (yù): Think of earth(土 tǔ) and a domain somebody "possibly" (或 huò) controls-so, territory!
