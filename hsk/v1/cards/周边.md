# **周边 (zhōu biān) - Surroundings; periphery**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **周 (zhōu)**: Means "around, circle, week". Left: "冂 (jiōng)" (enclosure, outside), inside: "口 (kǒu)" (mouth), bottom: "土 (tǔ)" (earth). Suggests enclosure or surrounding.  
- **边 (biān)**: Means "side, edge". Left: "辶 (chuò)" (walk/movement radical), right: "力 (lì)" (power, here simplified from original component). Implies moving along an edge.

**Examples**:  
- 这里的周边 (zhè lǐ de zhōu biān) 很安静 (hěn ān jìng)。 - The surroundings here are very quiet.  
- 学校周边 (xué xiào zhōu biān) 有很多餐馆 (yǒu hěn duō cān guǎn)。 - There are many restaurants around the school.  
- 请注意周边环境 (qǐng zhù yì zhōu biān huán jìng)。 - Please pay attention to the surrounding environment.

**Usage Notes**:  
周边 (zhōu biān) is used for physical surroundings, nearby areas, or sometimes for peripheral products (e.g., 电影周边 (diàn yǐng zhōu biān), movie merchandise).

**Memory Aids**:  
周 (zhōu) means "around" (imagine an enclosure circling something); 边 (biān) is "edge/side". So, 周边 (zhōu biān) = all the edges around you = surroundings!
