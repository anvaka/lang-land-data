# **消耗 (xiāo hào) - to consume; to use up**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **消** (xiāo): Left = "氵" (shuǐ, water radical) refers to liquid; right = "肖" (xiào/xiāo, resemble) suggesting vanishing/diminishing. Implies "to disappear," "to vanish," or "to consume."  
- **耗** (hào): Left = "耒" (lěi, plow) for farming/tools; right = "毛" (máo, hair), together suggesting things being used up or worn away. Means "to expend" or "to consume resources."

**Examples**:  
- 运动会消耗(xiāo hào)了很多能量(néng liàng)。 (yùn dòng huì xiāo hào le hěn duō néng liàng) - The sports event consumed a lot of energy.  
- 这里的机器消耗(xiāo hào)水(shuǐ)很大。 (zhè lǐ de jī qì xiāo hào shuǐ hěn dà) - The machines here consume a lot of water.  
- 长时间工作会消耗(xiāo hào)体力(tǐ lì)。 (cháng shí jiān gōng zuò huì xiāo hào tǐ lì) - Working for a long time uses up physical strength.

**Usage Notes**:  
"消耗(xiāo hào)" usually refers to resources, energy, or strength being used up over time. It is often used for non-material things like energy, patience, or abstract resources.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of "消(xiāo)" (disappear) and "耗(hào)" (expend) together as resources slowly "disappearing" (xiāo) as you "use them up" (hào).
