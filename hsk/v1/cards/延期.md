# **延期 (yán qī) - to postpone; to delay**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **延** (yán): means "to extend" or "prolong." Left: 辶 (chuò) "walk/move" radical; right: 廴 (yǐn) "long stride" underneath, showing movement or extension.  
- **期** (qī): means "period" or "time." Left/top: 其 (qí) "its/that" phonetic; right/bottom: 月 (yuè) "moon/month" at the bottom, related to time.

**Examples**:  
- 会议(huì yì)延期(yán qī)到下周(xià zhōu)。(huì yì yán qī dào xià zhōu) - The meeting is postponed to next week.  
- 考试(kǎo shì)因为天气(yīn wèi tiān qì)被(bèi)延期(yán qī)了。(kǎo shì yīn wèi tiān qì bèi yán qī le) - The exam was postponed due to the weather.  
- 项目(xiàng mù)延期(yán qī)完成(wán chéng)。(xiàng mù yán qī wán chéng) - The project was completed later than planned.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **延期** (yán qī) is often used formally for scheduled events (meetings, projects, deadlines).  
- Usually followed by a new time (**到** dào + date/time).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine **延** (yán) "extending" a deadline and **期** (qī) as the "period" being moved. So **延期** (yán qī) is "extending the period."
