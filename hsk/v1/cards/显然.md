# **显然 (xiǎn rán) - Obviously / Clearly**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 显 (xiǎn): "To be evident, to show." Left: 日 (rì, "sun") meaning "brightness" + right: 见 (jiàn, "to see")-put together, it implies "clearly seen."  
- 然 (rán): "So, thus, like this." Top: 肰 (rán, "meat/flesh") + bottom/right: 灬 (huǒ, "fire," as four dots), originally forms adjectives/adverbs.

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 显然 (xiǎn rán) 很 (hěn) 高兴 (gāo xìng)。 (Tā xiǎn rán hěn gāo xìng.) - He is obviously very happy.  
- 显然 (xiǎn rán)，你 (nǐ) 没 (méi) 准备 (zhǔn bèi)。 (Xiǎn rán, nǐ méi zhǔn bèi.) - Obviously, you didn't prepare.  
- 事实 (shì shí) 显然 (xiǎn rán) 如此 (rú cǐ)。 (Shì shí xiǎn rán rú cǐ.) - The facts are obviously so.

**Usage Notes**:  
显然 (xiǎn rán) is used as an adverb or conjunction at the beginning or in the middle of a sentence to show something is obvious or clear in context; often stronger than 明显 (míng xiǎn, "clear/obvious" as an adjective).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "Sun (日, rì) + see (见, jiàn)" = "what is clearly seen." 然 (rán) often appears in adverbs like 果然 (guǒ rán, "as expected").  
"显然 (xiǎn rán)" = "the result is shown and obvious."
