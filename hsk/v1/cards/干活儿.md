# **干活儿 (gàn huór) - To work; to do chores**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **干** (gàn): means "to do" or "to work." Top: "十" (shí) meaning "ten"; bottom: "丨" (gǔn), a vertical line. Distinct from **干** (gān, "dry").  
- **活** (huó): means "to live" or "activity/work." Left: "氵" (shuǐ), the water radical; right: "舌" (shé), meaning "tongue."  
- **儿** (ér): diminutive suffix, often used in spoken Chinese, especially in Northern China. Top: "⺹" shortened version; bottom: curved hook.

**Examples**:  
- 他正在干活儿。(Tā zhèngzài gàn huór.) - He is working right now.  
- 你要不要帮我干活儿？(Nǐ yào bù yào bāng wǒ gàn huór?) - Do you want to help me work?  
- 我每天都要干活儿。(Wǒ měitiān dōu yào gàn huór.) - I have to work every day.

**Usage Notes**:  
**干活儿** (gàn huór) is informal, often refers to manual labor or chores. In the South, the "儿" (ér) is often omitted, becoming **干活** (gàn huó).

**Memory Aids**:  
Picture yourself "doing" (**干** gàn) an "activity" (**活** huó), and the "儿" (ér) at the end makes it sound friendly and casual, like talking to a neighbor.
