# **只 (zhǐ) - only; merely / measure word for animals**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **只 (zhǐ)**: Left-right structure. Left: 口 (kǒu, "mouth" radical); Right: 八 (bā, "eight/divide" component). The combination originally meant "single, alone."

**Examples**:  
- 我( wǒ )只( zhǐ )有( yǒu )一( yī )个( gè )朋友( péngyǒu )。(Wǒ zhǐ yǒu yī gè péngyǒu.) - I only have one friend.  
- 他( tā )只( zhǐ )会( huì )说( shuō )中( zhōng )文( wén )。(Tā zhǐ huì shuō zhōngwén.) - He can only speak Chinese.  
- 一( yī )只( zhī )猫( māo )。(Yī zhī māo.) - One cat.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 只( zhǐ ) as "only" is adverbial and placed before verbs.  
- 只( zhī ) as a measure word uses the first tone and is for animals, some body parts.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine 口( kǒu ) as a "mouth" only allowing 八( bā ) ("eight") things at a time - just a few, or "only."  
- Think "only" one mouth for "only" one thing.
