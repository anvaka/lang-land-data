# **功夫 (gōngfu) - Kung fu; skill; effort**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **功 (gōng)**: "achievement; work; effort." Left: 力 (lì, "strength") on the bottom, representing physical force; right: 工 (gōng, "work") on the top, indicating manual labor.  
- **夫 (fū)**: "man; husband." Top: 大 (dà, "big/person with arms stretched"); bottom: 一 (yī, "one"), emphasizing a person standing tall.

**Examples**:  
- 他学了很多年功夫。(Tā xuéle hěn duō nián gōngfu.) - He studied kung fu for many years.  
- 练功夫需要耐心。(Liàn gōngfu xūyào nàixīn.) - Practicing kung fu requires patience.  
- 做好这件事要花很多功夫。(Zuò hǎo zhè jiàn shì yào huā hěn duō gōngfu.) - Doing this well takes a lot of effort.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 功夫 (gōngfu) often refers to Chinese martial arts, but also means "time, effort, or skill" in daily conversation.  
- Not always about fighting-can refer to any skill developed by hard work.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine achieving (功 gōng) something big (夫 fū) requires both skill and effort-just like learning kung fu or any skill!
