# **沉重 (chén zhòng) - heavy; weighty; grave**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 沉 (chén): "sink; deep"
  - Radical 氵 (shuǐ, water) on the left, conveys connection to liquid, water, or sinking.
  - Right part 冘 (yín), borrowed for sound.  
- 重 (zhòng): "heavy; serious"
  - Top 千 (qiān, thousand) gives phonetic clue.
  - Bottom 里 (lǐ, inside) hints at “density” or “weight within.”

**Examples**:  
- 他说话时语气很沉重。(Tā shuōhuà shí yǔqì hěn chénzhòng.) - He spoke in a heavy (serious) tone.  
- 我的行李太沉重了。(Wǒ de xínglǐ tài chénzhòng le.) - My luggage is too heavy.  
- 气氛变得沉重起来。(Qìfēn biàn de chénzhòng qǐlái.) - The atmosphere became heavy/serious.

**Usage Notes**:  
沉重 (chénzhòng) describes physical weight or serious emotional/atmospheric heaviness. Often used with feelings, voice, atmosphere, or objects.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: Adding water (沉 chén) makes objects sink and feel 重 (zhòng, heavy). Also, “沉沉的心情”(chénchén de xīnqíng, heavy mood) sounds repetitive, echoing the weight.
