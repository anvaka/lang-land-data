# **胆怯 (dǎn qiè) - Timid; Cowardly**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **胆 (dǎn):** "Gallbladder" (associated with courage). "月 (yuè)" radical (left; flesh/body) + "旦 (dàn)" (right; dawn/daybreak).  
- **怯 (qiè):** "Fearful, timid." "忄(xīn)" radical (left; heart) + "去 (qù)" (right; to go, depart).

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 因为 (yīnwèi) 胆怯 (dǎn qiè) 不敢 (bù gǎn) 发言 (fā yán)。 (He didn't dare to speak because he was timid.)  
- 她 (tā) 面对 (miàn duì) 挑战 (tiǎo zhàn) 时 (shí) 常常 (cháng cháng) 感到 (gǎn dào) 胆怯 (dǎn qiè)。 (She often feels timid facing challenges.)  
- 不要 (bù yào) 胆怯 (dǎn qiè)，试一试 (shì yī shì) 吧 (ba)! (Don't be timid, give it a try!)

**Usage Notes**:  
- Often describes a lack of courage (心理/mental).  
- Can modify people: 胆怯的孩子 (dǎn qiè de hái zi) - timid child.

**Memory Aids**:  
- "胆 (dǎn)" is the organ for bravery; "怯 (qiè)" means fear-so "胆怯 (dǎn qiè)" is literally "gallbladder afraid" = lacking courage.
