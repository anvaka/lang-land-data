# **普遍 (pǔbiàn) - Universal; Common; Widespread**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **普** (pǔ): At the **top**, the "日" (rì, sun) radical suggests brightness or spread; at the **bottom**, "并" (bìng) gives the idea of spreading together-overall meaning "universal" or "general."  
- **遍** (biàn): On the **left**, "辶" (chuò, walk/movement) radical; on the **right**, "扁" (biǎn, flat)-together suggesting "to go everywhere," "spread all over."

**Examples**:  
- 这种现象很**普遍**。(Zhè zhǒng xiànxiàng hěn pǔbiàn.) - This phenomenon is very common.  
- 网上购物已经变得很**普遍**。(Wǎngshàng gòuwù yǐjīng biàn de hěn pǔbiàn.) - Online shopping has already become very widespread.  
- **普遍**认为他很友好。(Pǔbiàn rènwéi tā hěn yǒuhǎo.) - He is generally considered friendly.

**Usage Notes**:  
- Usually modifies nouns to indicate "common" or "widespread."  
- Frequently used with verbs like 认为 (rènwéi, consider/think) or 描述 (miáoshù, describe).

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine the **sun** (日, rì) at the **top** shining **everywhere** (普, pǔ), and people are **walking** (辶, chuò, on the left of 遍, biàn) **all over** a space-making it **universal** or **common.**
