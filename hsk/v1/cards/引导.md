# **引导 (yǐn dǎo) - to guide; guidance**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **引 (yǐn)**: Means "to pull, to lead." Left side: "弓 (gōng)" (bow) indicates pulling; right side: "丨 (gǔn)" (vertical line), part of old forms representing action.  
- **导 (dǎo)**: Means "to guide, to direct." Top: "⻌ (chuò)" (walking radical) indicating movement; bottom: "巳 (sì)" (silkworm), a phonetic component.

**Examples**:  
- 老师 (lǎoshī) 引导 (yǐn dǎo) 学生 (xuéshēng) 提问 (tíwèn)。 (The teacher guides students to ask questions.)  
- 请 (qǐng) 引导 (yǐn dǎo) 我们 (wǒmen) 参观 (cānguān)。 (Please guide us on the tour.)  
- 家长 (jiāzhǎng) 应该 (yīnggāi) 正确 (zhèngquè) 引导 (yǐn dǎo) 孩子 (háizi)。 (Parents should properly guide their children.)

**Usage Notes**:  
- 引导 (yǐn dǎo) is used for both literal (physically leading) and figurative (giving advice, instructions) guidance.  
- Commonly used as a verb or noun (给予引导 (jǐyǔ yǐn dǎo) - give guidance).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine 引 (yǐn) as "pulling with a bow," and 导 (dǎo) as "moving" (walking radical) and "directing" (guiding the silk’s path); together: "pull and direct" → to guide.
