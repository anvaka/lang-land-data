# **广泛 (guǎng fàn) - Broad; Extensive**

- **泛** (fàn): Means "to spread out" or "general." Left: "氵" (shuǐ, water radical) signifies relation to water; right: "乏" (fá) suggests "to float;" together hint at wide-spreading water.

Imagine 广 (guǎng, wide building) with 泛 (fàn, water spreading everywhere) = "coverage spreading broadly, like water flooding a large building."
