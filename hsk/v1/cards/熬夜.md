**Character Breakdown**:

- **夜** (yè): "night." Top: "亠" (tóu, lid); middle: "亦" (yì, also); bottom: "夕" (xī, evening), showing its relation to nighttime.

**Usage Notes**:

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine "熬" (áo, endure heat) as enduring the burning "fire" (huǒ) of staying awake.  
- "夜" (yè, night) reminds you this happens at night-so **熬夜** (áoyè) is "enduring the night."
