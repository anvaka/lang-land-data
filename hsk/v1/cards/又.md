# **又 (yòu) - again; both…and; also**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **又** (yòu): Pictograph of a right hand. The single stroke on the right (representing a thumb) is attached to a hand shape on the left. Appears as a stand-alone character.

**Examples**:  
- 他(tā)又(yòu)迟到(chí dào)了(le)。 (Tā yòu chídào le.) - He was late again.  
- 今天(jīn tiān)又(yòu)下雨(xià yǔ)了(le)。 (Jīntiān yòu xiàyǔ le.) - It’s raining again today.  
- 她(tā)又(yòu)聪明(cōng míng)又(yòu)漂亮(piào liang)。 (Tā yòu cōngmíng yòu piàoliang.) - She is both smart and beautiful.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **又(yòu)** is used to express repeated actions in the past or present, not future (use 再(zài) for future).  
- Structure: 又(yòu)…又(yòu)… = both…and… for adjectives/verbs.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine the character as a "hand (又(yòu))" doing something AGAIN and AGAIN.  
- "又(yòu)" sounds like "yo!"-as if someone is calling out repeatedly.
