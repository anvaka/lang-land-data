# **大致 (dà zhì) - roughly; approximately**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **大** (dà) - "big", "major." The radical is 一 (yī) on top, with 大 (dà) forming the entire character, resembling a person with arms stretched out wide - something large or vast.  
- **致** (zhì) - "to cause," "to send," "to convey." Left: 至 (zhì, "to arrive") is on the left; right: 攵 (pū, "action hand") is on the right, suggesting delivering or leading to a result.

**Examples**:  
- 这只是大致(dà zhì)的数字。(Zhè zhǐ shì dà zhì de shùzì.) - This is just an approximate number.  
- 我们大致(dà zhì)了解了情况。(Wǒmen dà zhì liǎojiě le qíngkuàng.) - We have roughly understood the situation.  
- 他大致(dà zhì)会在七点到达。(Tā dà zhì huì zài qī diǎn dàodá.) - He will arrive at about seven o'clock.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **大致(dà zhì)** is an adverb/adjective used to express approximation or generality, often before verbs or when qualifying statements.  
- Common with numbers, plans, and understandings.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a "big (大,dà)" idea that "leads to (致,zhì)" just the general shape, not the details-so, **大致(dà zhì)** = "roughly" or "approximately."
