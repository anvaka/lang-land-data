# **其他 (qí tā) - other; others**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **其** (qí): top - "八" (bā, eight); bottom - "甘" (gān, sweet). Originally refers to "his/her/its; that," now often just means "that" or "other."  
- **他** (tā): left - "亻" (rén, person radical), right - "也" (yě, also). Basic meaning is "he" or "other."

**Examples**:  
- 请问有其他(qí tā)问题吗？(qǐng wèn yǒu qí tā wèn tí ma?) - Do you have any other questions?  
- 其他(qí tā)人都去了。(qí tā rén dōu qù le.) - The other people have all gone.  
- 我不喜欢其他(qí tā)颜色。(wǒ bù xǐ huan qí tā yán sè.) - I don't like the other colors.

**Usage Notes**:  
- As an adjective: 其他(qí tā)+noun.  
- As a pronoun: means "other ones" or "others."  
- Not used for animate objects as pronoun; usually replaced by 别的(bié de) with people.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine "其"(qí) standing for "that," and "他"(tā) (he/other person) together as "that other (thing/person)".  
- Remember: "其"(qí) is generic, "他"(tā) is "other/another."
