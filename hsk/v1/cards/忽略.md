# **忽略 (hūlüè) - to ignore / to neglect**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **忽 (hū)**: Left = “心 (xīn, heart)” radical at the bottom, suggesting feelings/intent; top = "勿 (wù, not)"-together implying "to disregard."  
- **略 (lüè)**: Left = “田 (tián, field)” radical; right = “各 (gè, each)”-originally meant "strategy" or "outline," here means "to omit" or "skip over."

**Examples**:  
- 他忽略了我的话。(Tā hūlüè le wǒ de huà.) - He ignored what I said.  
- 不要忽略细节。(Bùyào hūlüè xìjié.) - Don't neglect the details.  
- 她经常忽略自己的健康。(Tā jīngcháng hūlüè zìjǐ de jiànkāng.) - She often neglects her health.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 忽略 (hūlüè) is usually used for accidentally/unknowingly forgetting or not paying attention, not purposely.  
- Can apply to matters (e.g., 工作 (gōngzuò), 细节 (xìjié)), feelings (e.g., 感受 (gǎnshòu)), or people.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 忽 (hū) sounds like "who?"-as if you ignore someone asking, "who cares?"  
- 略 (lüè) is in 策略 (cèlüè, strategy)-a "strategy" of skipping over or omitting things.
