# **跟 (gēn) - to follow; with**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **跟** (gēn): Left side is 足 (zú, "foot") suggesting action or movement; right side is 艮 (gèn, "stopping/looking back"). Put together, "foot" plus "look back" = following.

**Examples**:  
- 我(wǒ)跟(gēn)你(nǐ)一起(yīqǐ)去(qù)。 (Wǒ gēn nǐ yīqǐ qù.) - I go with you.  
- 请(qǐng)跟(gēn)我(wǒ)说(shuō)。 (Qǐng gēn wǒ shuō.) - Please repeat after me.  
- 他(tā)跟(gēn)妈妈(māma)走(zǒu)了(le)。 (Tā gēn māma zǒu le.) - He left with his mom.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **跟** (gēn) means "with" when linking people or actions; often used before persons.  
- Can also mean "to follow" (physically or in conversation).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a foot (足, zú) following someone, always watching their movements (艮, gèn = look back), so **跟** (gēn) means "with" or "follow".
