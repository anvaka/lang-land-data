# **数码 (shù mǎ) - Digital**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 数 (shù): number, count. Left: 攵 (pū, "to tap/strike", bottom right); Right/top: 娄 (lóu, related to "collecting/arranging"), suggesting counting actions.  
- 码 (mǎ): code, number, yard. Left: 石 (shí, "stone", left); Right: 马 (mǎ, "horse", right), originally meant a measure of land, now often "code".

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢用数码相机。(Wǒ xǐhuān yòng shùmǎ xiàngjī.) - I like to use digital cameras.  
- 这个文件是数码格式的。(Zhège wénjiàn shì shùmǎ géshì de.) - This file is in digital format.  
- 现在很多产品都是数码产品。(Xiànzài hěn duō chǎnpǐn dōu shì shùmǎ chǎnpǐn.) - Many products today are digital products.

**Usage Notes**:  
数码 (shùmǎ) usually describes technology (e.g., 数码相机 shùmǎ xiàngjī "digital camera" or 数码产品 shùmǎ chǎnpǐn "digital products"). Less commonly used alone in daily speech.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: 数 (shù, numbers) + 码 (mǎ, code) = "number codes," just like digital data is encoded by numbers.
