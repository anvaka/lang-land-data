# **咱们 (zánmen) - we; us (inclusive)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **咱** (zán): Left - 口(kǒu, “mouth” radical); right - 斤(jīn, “axe”). Used in Northern Chinese to mean "we" including the listener.  
- **们** (men): Left - 亻(rén, “person” radical); right - 门(mén, “door”). Plural marker for pronouns/people.

**Examples**:  
- 咱们(zánmen)一起(yìqǐ)去(qù)吧(ba)。 (zánmen yìqǐ qù ba.) - Let’s go together.  
- 咱们(zánmen)都是(dōu shì)好朋友(hǎo péngyǒu)。 (zánmen dōu shì hǎo péngyǒu.) - We are all good friends.  
- 咱们(zánmen)吃(chī)饭(fàn)了吗(le ma)？ (zánmen chī fàn le ma?) - Have we eaten?

**Usage Notes**:  
咱们(zánmen) refers to “we,” including both the speaker and listener. More common in Northern China; in formal writing or Southern dialects, 我们(wǒmen) is often used instead.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 咱(zán), which has 口(kǒu, "mouth") - everyone with mouths talking together as a group - then add 们(men) to make it plural: “we, all together.”
