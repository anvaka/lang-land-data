# **立交桥 (lìjiāoqiáo) - Overpass / Grade separation bridge**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **立 (lì)**: to stand, erect. The top is “立” radical, resembles a person standing.  
- **交 (jiāo)**: to exchange, intersect. Top is "父 (fù)" component, bottom strokes cross to indicate intersection.  
- **桥 (qiáo)**: bridge. Left is "木 (mù)" radical (wood/trees), right is "乔 (qiáo)" meaning tall.

**Examples**:  
- 城市里有很多立交桥。(Chéngshì lǐ yǒu hěn duō lìjiāoqiáo.) - There are many overpasses in the city.  
- 我们要从立交桥下走过去。(Wǒmen yào cóng lìjiāoqiáo xià zǒu guòqù.) - We need to walk under the overpass.  
- 这座立交桥设计得很巧妙。(Zhè zuò lìjiāoqiáo shèjì dé hěn qiǎomiào.) - This overpass is cleverly designed.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 立交桥 (lìjiāoqiáo) is used for roadways/rail overpasses where tracks or streets cross without intersecting at grade. Common in urban traffic.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine cars "standing" (立 lì) as they "interchange/cross" (交 jiāo) on a "wooden bridge" (桥 qiáo).
