# **要不 (yào bù) - "Otherwise; or else; how about"**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **要 (yào)**: "to want; need; important". The top is "⺧ (yáng)", resembling a head with horns (often meaning 'appearance'), and the bottom is "女 (nǚ)" meaning 'woman', suggesting value or necessity.  
- **不 (bù)**: "not; no". One horizontal stroke on top (symbolizing heaven) over a downward stroke, meaning negation.

**Examples**:  
- 我们晚点走，要不(yào bù)你会迟到。(Wǒmen wǎndiǎn zǒu, yào bù nǐ huì chídào.) - We’ll leave later, otherwise you’ll be late.  
- 要不(yào bù)我们吃火锅？(Yào bù wǒmen chī huǒguō?) - How about we eat hot pot?  
- 你先说话，要不(yào bù)我来？(Nǐ xiān shuōhuà, yào bù wǒ lái?) - Will you speak first, or should I?

**Usage Notes**:  
- Often at the start or middle of a sentence to suggest an alternative, offer a choice, or warn of consequences.  
- Can mean "otherwise," "or else," or "how about".

**Memory Aids**:  
- 要(yào) = "want", 不(bù) = "not" → "want not?" → offering another choice or warning what happens "if not".
