# **沙滩 (shā tān) - Beach**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **沙** (shā): "sand." Left: "氵" (shuǐ, water radical) hints at relation to water. Right: "少" (shǎo, few/little), signifying small particles.  
- **滩** (tān): "beach/shore." Left: "氵" (shuǐ, water radical), indicating water. Right: "难" (nán), here for phonetic value, not meaning.

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢去沙滩(shā tān)散步。(Wǒ xǐhuān qù shā tān sànbù.) - I like to take walks on the beach.  
- 沙滩(shā tān)上有很多贝壳。(Shā tān shàng yǒu hěn duō bèiké.) - There are many shells on the beach.  
- 孩子们在沙滩(shā tān)上玩耍。(Háizimen zài shā tān shàng wánshuǎ.) - Children are playing on the beach.

**Usage Notes**:  
"沙滩" (shā tān) is usually used for beaches by the sea or large lakes, not riverbanks. Pairs with verbs like "去" (qù, to go), "在" (zài, at), "晒" (shài, to sunbathe).

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine the "氵" (shuǐ, water) radicals in both "沙" (shā) and "滩" (tān) showing the beach's connection to water, and "少" (shǎo) as tiny sand grains.
