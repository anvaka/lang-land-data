# **其余 (qíyú) - the rest; the remaining; others**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **其 (qí)**: Top: "其" depicts a stand and a mouth, originally meaning "his/her/its/their" or "that"; used for third-person or to indicate possession.  
- **余 (yú)**: Top: "人 (rén)" person radical; Bottom: "木 (mù)" tree radical. Together, signifies "surplus" or "remaining" (originally referred to surplus harvest).

**Examples**:  
- 请把其余 (qíyú) 的钱还给我。(Qǐng bǎ qíyú de qián huán gěi wǒ.) - Please return the rest of the money to me.  
- 我吃完了，其余 (qíyú) 的给你吧。(Wǒ chī wán le, qíyú de gěi nǐ ba.) - I'm done eating, you can have the rest.  
- 会议其余 (qíyú) 部分将在下午进行。(Huìyì qíyú bùfen jiāng zài xiàwǔ jìnxíng.) - The remaining part of the meeting will be held in the afternoon.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 其余 (qíyú) is used as a pronoun or adjective for "the others" or "the rest."  
- Often followed by "的 (de)," modifying nouns or referring to groups.

**Memory Aids**:  
- **其 (qí)** = "that/other," **余 (yú)** = "leftover"; together, imagine "other leftovers" => "the rest."  
- Picture people (人 rén) under a tree (木 mù), staying behind: those are the "remaining" (余 yú) ones.
