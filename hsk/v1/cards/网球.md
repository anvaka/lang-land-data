# **网球 (wǎngqiú) - Tennis**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 网 (wǎng): net; the radical "罒" (wǎng, meaning "net") is on the top, covering "亡" (wáng, meaning "to flee" or "to perish") at the bottom.  
- 球 (qiú): ball; "王" (wáng, jade/king) is on the left, representing jade, and "求" (qiú, to seek) is on the right. The whole character refers to a round object (ball or sphere).

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢打网球。(Wǒ xǐhuan dǎ wǎngqiú.) - I like to play tennis.  
- 网球比赛很精彩。(Wǎngqiú bǐsài hěn jīngcǎi.) - The tennis match is exciting.  
- 你会打网球吗？(Nǐ huì dǎ wǎngqiú ma?) - Can you play tennis?

**Usage Notes**:  
- 打 (dǎ) (to play/hit) is the common verb for 网球 (wǎngqiú).  
- 网球 (wǎngqiú) refers specifically to the sport, not the net or ball alone.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine hitting a ball (球, qiú) over a net (网, wǎng): **net-ball = tennis**.  
- 网 (wǎng) looks like a net stretched at the top; 球 (qiú) has the circular "king" component-a royal ball!
