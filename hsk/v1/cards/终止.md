# **终止 (zhōngzhǐ) - to terminate; to end**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 终 (zhōng): "end, finish." Left: 纟(sī) "silk" radical, indicating association with thread or continuity. Right: 冬(dōng), which means "winter," suggestive of an ending season.  
- 止 (zhǐ): "stop." Top: 止(zhǐ) pictograph of a stopped foot, representing stopping movement.

**Examples**:  
- 合同已终止。(Hétóng yǐ zhōngzhǐ.) - The contract has been terminated.  
- 双方决定终止合作。(Shuāngfāng juédìng zhōngzhǐ hézuò.) - Both parties decided to end the cooperation.  
- 项目被迫终止了。(Xiàngmù bèi pò zhōngzhǐ le.) - The project was forced to stop.

**Usage Notes**:  
终止(zhōngzhǐ) is formal and often used in legal, official, or formal contexts; less common in daily conversation compared to 完( wán, "finish") or 停止( tíngzhǐ, "stop").

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 终(zhōng) as the "end" (like winter is the end of the year), and 止(zhǐ) as "stop;" together, 终止(zhōngzhǐ) means to bring something to a complete stop.
