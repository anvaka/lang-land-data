# **穷 (qióng) - poor; impoverished**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 穷 (qióng): Top is 穴 (xué, "cave" radical), indicating a dwelling or shelter. Bottom is 力 (lì, "strength"/"power"), symbolizing effort or force. Together, it evokes someone putting effort but limited to a cave, symbolizing poverty.

**Examples**:  
- 他很穷。(Tā hěn qióng.) - He is very poor.  
- 我们小时候很穷。(Wǒmen xiǎoshíhòu hěn qióng.) - We were poor when we were young.  
- 穷人需要帮助。(Qióngrén xūyào bāngzhù.) - Poor people need help.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 穷 (qióng) describes poverty in material wealth or resources.  
- Can extend metaphorically to things like 知识穷 (zhīshì qióng, "poor in knowledge").

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine living in a cave (穴, xué) with only your strength (力, lì) left-you're 穷 (qióng).  
- "Qióng" sounds like "chong" in "nothing to chong (change)"-nothing left!
