# **交涉 (jiāo shè) - to negotiate / to mediate**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 交 (jiāo): to exchange, to interact. Top: 父 (fù, "father"-like component), bottom: a twist representing mutual acts or crossing.  
- 涉 (shè): to wade, to be involved. Left: 氵(shuǐ, water radical), right: 步 (bù, step). Indicates movement through water, metaphorically involvement.

**Examples**:  
- 双方正在交涉。(Shuāngfāng zhèngzài jiāoshè.) - The two parties are negotiating.  
- 他负责和对方交涉。(Tā fùzé hé duìfāng jiāoshè.) - He is responsible for negotiating with the other side.  
- 经过多次交涉，我们达成了协议。(Jīngguò duō cì jiāoshè, wǒmen dáchéngle xiéyì.) - After many negotiations, we reached an agreement.

**Usage Notes**:  
交涉 (jiāo shè) is formal, common in business, legal, or diplomatic contexts; not for casual bargaining-use 谈判 (tánpàn) or 商量 (shāngliang) depending on context.

**Memory Aids**:  
交 (jiāo) = crossing/exchange, 涉 (shè) = wading in, so 交涉 (jiāo shè) is "stepping into an exchange," i.e., entering negotiation.
