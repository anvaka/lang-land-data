# **万一 (wàn yī) - just in case; in case; by any chance**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **万 (wàn)**: ten thousand. Top: a horizontal stroke; bottom: resembles "力 (lì)" (strength).  
- **一 (yī)**: one. Single horizontal stroke. Simple and foundational.

**Examples**:  
- 万一(wàn yī)下雨(xià yǔ)，记得(jì dé)带伞(dài sǎn)。 (In case it rains, remember to bring an umbrella.)  
- 万一(wàn yī)你(nǐ)不(bù)来(lái)，我(wǒ)怎么办(zěn me bàn)？ (What if you don't come, what should I do?)  
- 万一(wàn yī)出错(chū cuò)，要小心(yào xiǎo xīn)。 (Be careful in case something goes wrong.)

**Usage Notes**:  
- 万一(wàn yī) is used before a hypothetical or unlikely event to mean "in case something happens" or "just in case."  
- Often at the start of a clause.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think: "Ten thousand against one"-if there's even a 1 in 10,000 chance, prepare for it!  
- 万(wàn) = many, 一(yī) = one → even a tiny chance!
