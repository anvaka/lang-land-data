# **课 (kè) - class; lesson; course**

**Character Breakdown**:  
课 (kè):  
- Left: 讠(yán) "speech" radical, indicating relevance to language or speech.  
- Right: 果 (guǒ) "fruit/result," suggesting something produced or achieved (here, the result of teaching).

**Examples**:  
- 我有中文课。(Wǒ yǒu zhōngwén kè.) - I have Chinese class.  
- 你今天上了几节课？(Nǐ jīntiān shàng le jǐ jié kè?) - How many classes did you have today?  
- 这节课很有意思。(Zhè jié kè hěn yǒuyìsi.) - This class is very interesting.

**Usage Notes**:  
课 (kè) refers to individual classes, lessons, or courses. It is often used with measure word 节 (jié) for periods ("一节课" (yī jié kè) - one class period). Also appears in compound words like 课程 (kèchéng) "curriculum/course".

**Memory Aids**:  
Remember 课 (kè): Speaking (讠(yán)) in class leads to fruit (果 (guǒ)) of learning-your lessons!
