# **再 (zài) - again; once more**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 再 (zài):
  - Radical: 冂 (jiōng, "open box", top/outside)
  - Component: 一 (yī, "one", middle)
  - Component: 冉 (rǎn, "rise", bottom/inside)
  - Originally means “again; once more,” indicating repetition.

**Examples**:  
- 请再(zài)说一遍(qǐng zài shuō yí biàn) - Please say it again.  
- 他再(zài)来一次(tā zài lái yí cì) - He comes again.  
- 我想再(zài)试试(wǒ xiǎng zài shì shi) - I want to try again.

**Usage Notes**:  
再(zài) is usually used before verbs to mean “again” (in the future or a repeat action). For actions already completed, use 又(yòu).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 再(zài) as a “top” line (一) reappearing “again” above what’s already there-something happening again.
