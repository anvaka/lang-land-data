# **只好 (zhǐ hǎo) - have no choice but; can only**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **只 (zhǐ)**: "only." Left: 口 (kǒu, "mouth"). Right: 八 (bā, "eight"/division) over a small horizontal stroke, like a simplified bird; here, it serves to express limitation or singularity.  
- **好 (hǎo)**: "good." Left: 女 (nǚ, "woman"). Right: 子 (zǐ, "child"). Together, "woman + child" conveys traditional ideas of goodness.

**Examples**:  
- 天下雨了，我只好(zhǐ hǎo)在家。(Tiān xià yǔ le, wǒ zhǐ hǎo zài jiā.) - It started to rain, so I had no choice but to stay home.  
- 没有车了，我们只好(zhǐ hǎo)走路。(Méi yǒu chē le, wǒmen zhǐ hǎo zǒu lù.) - There’s no car, so we can only walk.  
- 他没带伞，只好(zhǐ hǎo)跑回家。(Tā méi dài sǎn, zhǐ hǎo pǎo huí jiā.) - He didn’t bring an umbrella, so he had to run home.

**Usage Notes**:  
只好(zhǐ hǎo) is used before a verb to show that due to external circumstances, one is forced to do something. It implies resignation and lack of better alternatives.

**Memory Aids**:  
只(zhǐ) is "only" + 好(hǎo) "can do" = "the only thing I can do." Imagine yourself sighing and saying, "Only (只, zhǐ) can do good (好, hǎo) enough," meaning you must settle for this choice.
