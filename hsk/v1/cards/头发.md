# **头发 (tóu fa) - Hair**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 头 (tóu): "Head". Radical: 页 (yè, "head" radical) at the bottom, with 囗 (wéi, "enclosure") on the outside and 大 (dà, "big") inside, suggesting the form of a head.  
- 发 (fa): "To emit", here means "hair." Radical: 又 (yòu, "right hand") at the bottom, 友 (yǒu, "friend") shape on the top. Often simplified from 髪 (fà, "hair").

**Examples**:  
- 她的头发很长。(Tā de tóu fa hěn cháng.) - Her hair is very long.  
- 我剪了头发。(Wǒ jiǎn le tóu fa.) - I got a haircut.  
- 你喜欢染头发吗？(Nǐ xǐ huan rǎn tóu fa ma?) - Do you like dyeing your hair?

**Usage Notes**:  
头发 (tóu fa) refers specifically to the hair on your head. For body hair, use 体毛 (tǐ máo).

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine 头 (tóu, "head") + 发 (fa, "emitting") = "What grows out from your head" → hair!
