# **零 (líng) - zero / zero point / fragmentary**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 雨 (yǔ) "rain" at the top: Suggests small drops, relating to things scattered or insignificant.  
- 令 (lìng) "order" inside/bottom: Often relates to commands or seasons. Here, gives the sound.

**Examples**:

- 她得了零分。(Tā dé le líng fēn.) - She got zero points.  
- 零钱放在哪里？(Língqián fàng zài nǎlǐ?) - Where is the change (small coins)?

**Usage Notes**:  
- Used in numbers, temperatures, and expressing "none".  
- Often appears in "零钱 (língqián)" (small change) and "零食 (língshí)" (snack: small, fragmentary food).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine raindrops (雨 yǔ) falling until nothing (零 líng) is left-just zero.  
- "令 (lìng)" inside "rain"-like an ORDER to become zero!
