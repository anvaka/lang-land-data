**Character Breakdown**:  
- **平** (píng): flat, level. Left-right structure; left is "干" (gān), right is "一" (yī) on top of "八" (bā). Suggests something even or balanced.  
- **方** (fāng): square, direction. Has "亠" (tóu, lid) on top, "万" (wàn, ten thousand, here meaning place/area) below. Indicates shape or area.

**Usage Notes**:

- In math, can be both noun ("the square") and verb ("to raise to the power of two").

**Memory Aids**:  
- **平**(píng) is smooth/level, just like a flat surface; **方**(fāng) means square/shape-together, think of a perfect, even square.
