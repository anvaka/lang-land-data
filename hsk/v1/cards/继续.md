# **继续 (jìxù) - to continue**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **继 (jì)**: Left is 纟(sī) "silk" radical (left), right is 㠯(yǐ) "by means of" (right); together relates to “succession” or carrying on, as silk thread extends continuously.  
- **续 (xù)**: Left is 纟(sī) "silk" radical (left), right is 卖(mài) modified (right); original meaning is “to join (with thread)” or “continue.”

**Examples**:  
- 请 (qǐng) 继续 (jìxù)。 (qǐng jìxù.) - Please continue.  
- 他 (tā) 继续 (jìxù) 工作 (gōngzuò)。 (tā jìxù gōngzuò.) - He continues working.  
- 雨 (yǔ) 会 (huì) 继续 (jìxù) 下 (xià)。 (yǔ huì jìxù xià.) - The rain will continue.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 继续 (jìxù) is a verb and is often followed by another verb: 继续 (jìxù) + [action], e.g., 继续 (jìxù) 学习 (xuéxí) (to keep studying).  
- Used for actions/events in progress or that will resume.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Both 继 (jì) and 续 (xù) have 纟(sī) "silk" on the left, like one silk thread continuing from another-just as an action continues.
