# **目的 (mùdì) - Purpose; Goal**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **目 (mù)**: "eye," "to look." Radical at top is "目 (mù)" meaning "eye."  
- **的 (dì)**: "target," particle used for possession/adjectives. Left is "白 (bái, white)" and right is "勺 (sháo, spoon)."

**Examples**:  
- 我 (wǒ) 的 (de) 目的 (mùdì) 是 (shì) 学习 (xuéxí) 汉语 (Hànyǔ)。 (My purpose is to study Chinese.)  
- 他的 (tā de) 目的 (mùdì) 很 (hěn) 明确 (míngquè)。 (His goal is very clear.)  
- 你 (nǐ) 的 (de) 目的 (mùdì) 是 (shì) 什么 (shénme)？ (What is your purpose?)

**Usage Notes**:  
- 目的 (mùdì) can refer to a general goal or specific intent.  
- Often used after 的 (de) to describe possession or objective.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 目 (mù, eye) is what you focus on; 的 (dì, target) is what you aim for-so 目的 (mùdì) is what your eyes are set on: your goal!
