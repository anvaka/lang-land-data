# **节奏 (jiézòu) - Rhythm, tempo**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **节 (jié)**: Left is 竹(zhú, bamboo) radical on top, representing bamboo or something regular/repeating; right is 卩(jié), often phonetic. Means "section," "node," or "festival."  
- **奏 (zòu)**: Left is 奏(zòu) itself, component structure with top 𠂉(gōng, “bow” shape), center 天(tiān, sky), bottom 又(yòu, “again” hand); means "to play (music)," "to present (to a superior)."

**Examples**:  
- 这首歌的节奏(jíezòu)很快。(Zhè shǒu gē de jiézòu hěn kuài.) - The rhythm of this song is fast.  
- 跑步时要注意节奏(jiézòu)。(Pǎobù shí yào zhùyì jiézòu.) - Pay attention to the rhythm while running.  
- 他的生活节奏(jiézòu)很慢。(Tā de shēnghuó jiézòu hěn màn.) - His life pace is slow.

**Usage Notes**:  
节奏(jiézòu) can refer to musical rhythm or the pace/tempo of activities (work/life/living). Often used in both literal and metaphorical contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
节(jié, nodes/joints) + 奏(zòu, play music) = "the way musical notes (sections) are played" = rhythm/tempo.  
Think of "节(jíe, bamboo nodes)" marking each beat and "奏(zòu, performance)" tying them together.
