# **妥当 (tuǒdàng) - Proper; Appropriate**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 妥 (tuǒ): On the left, "女" (nǚ, woman); on the right, "千" (qiān, thousand). Suggests "a woman calmly arranging a thousand things"-implying "settled/suitable."  
- 当 (dàng): Top, "⺌" (xiǎo, small); middle, "田" (tián, field); bottom, "寸" (cùn, inch). Indicates something fitting or matching, thus "appropriate."

**Examples**:  
- 你的做法很妥当。(Nǐ de zuòfǎ hěn tuǒdàng.) - Your approach is very appropriate.  
- 我会选择妥当的时间联系你。(Wǒ huì xuǎnzé tuǒdàng de shíjiān liánxì nǐ.) - I’ll contact you at an appropriate time.  
- 请处理这件事要妥当。(Qǐng chǔlǐ zhè jiàn shì yào tuǒdàng.) - Please handle this matter properly.

**Usage Notes**:  
妥当 (tuǒdàng) is an adjective, often used for actions, decisions, or things to mean "proper," "well-handled," or "suitable." Can also be written as 妥帖 (tuǒtiē), but 妥当 (tuǒdàng) is more formal.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "A woman (女, nǚ) with a thousand (千, qiān) tasks finds the *proper* (妥, tuǒ) way to do things; if it’s *appropriate* (当, dàng), it fits just right like 'measured fields' (田, tián) arranged by inches (寸, cùn)."
