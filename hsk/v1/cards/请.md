# **请 (qǐng) - Please / To invite**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **请** (qǐng): Left **讠** (yán) “speech” radical. Right **青** (qīng, "blue/green", phonetic), which itself splits into top **龶** (variant of **生 shēng** “life”) + bottom **月 yuè** “moon/flesh”. The composition suggests "speaking politely" or "inviting".


**Examples**:  
- 请进。(qǐng jìn) - Please come in.  
- 请问，你叫什么名字？(qǐng wèn, nǐ jiào shénme míngzì?) - Excuse me, what is your name?  
- 请坐。(qǐng zuò) - Please sit.

**Usage Notes**:  
- Used for polite requests, invitations, or offering.  
- Precedes verbs to soften commands (e.g. 请拿(qǐng ná) "please take").  
- Use in formal and informal speech.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 讠(yán) = speech + 青(qīng) = clear/pure → Speak with clarity = "please" or "invite".  
- Imagine saying “please” brings a clear (青(qīng)) and pleasant mood in conversation.
