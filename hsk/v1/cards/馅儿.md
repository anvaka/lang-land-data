# **馅儿 (xiànr) - Filling (for dumplings, buns, etc.)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **馅 (xiàn)**: Left side is the "food" radical 饣(shí) indicating relation to food; right side 咸(xián) means "salty."  
- **儿 (r)**: Suffix pronounced in Beijing accent, often added to nouns; the character looks like a child with arms down (bottom).

**Examples**:  
- 包子的馅儿很美味。(Bāozi de xiànr hěn měiwèi.) - The bun's filling is delicious.  
- 你喜欢什么馅儿的饺子？(Nǐ xǐhuān shénme xiànr de jiǎozi?) - What filling do you like for dumplings?  
- 这个饼有豆沙馅儿。(Zhège bǐng yǒu dòushā xiànr.) - This pastry has red bean paste filling.

**Usage Notes**:  
馅儿(xiànr) is mostly used in northern China, especially Beijing, due to the retroflex "儿(r)" sound. In the south, just 馅(xiàn) is used. Refers specifically to the inside stuffing of buns, dumplings, etc.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: 馅(xiàn) has the "food" part on the left-it's what's inside (inside your food)! The 儿(r) sound makes it extra "northern"-like a child (儿(r)) munching on stuffed food.
