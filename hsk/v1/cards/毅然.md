**Character Breakdown**:  
- 毅 (yì): Left is "殳 (shū)" meaning weapon/tool, right is "豙 (yì)", together suggesting perseverance or determination.  
- 然 (rán): Left is "⺣ (huǒ)" fire radical on top, right is "月 (yuè)" (moon/flesh) over "犬 (quǎn)" (dog); often used as a suffix meaning "in such a state."

**Memory Aids**:
