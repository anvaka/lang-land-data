# **学习 (xuéxí) - to study; to learn**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 学 (xué): Top has “⺍” (small), represents a roof-originally a child under a roof, implying a school; bottom is “子” (zǐ, child).  
- 习 (xí): Top is “羽” (yǔ, feather), bottom is “白” (bái, white); together, originally means "practice" as birds practice flying.

**Examples**:  
- 我在学习中文。(Wǒ zài xuéxí zhōngwén.) - I am studying Chinese.  
- 你喜欢学习吗？(Nǐ xǐhuan xuéxí ma?) - Do you like learning?  
- 学习很重要。(Xuéxí hěn zhòngyào.) - Studying is important.

**Usage Notes**:  
学习 (xuéxí) can be a verb (“to study/learn”) or noun (“study/learning”). Used for both academic and skill-learning contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 学 (xué) as "child under a roof at school" and 习 (xí) as "birds practicing flying"-learning takes place under a roof, and improvement comes with practice.
