# **产品 (chǎn pǐn) - Product**

**Usage Notes**:  
产品 (chǎn pǐn) is typically used for tangible goods or manufactured items. Not often used for services.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 产 (chǎn): Picture a plant "producing" by sprouting up (立 lì "standing") from the ground (⺩ radical for production).  
- 品 (pǐn): Three mouths (口 kǒu) "taste" and "judge" quality-hence, a "product."
