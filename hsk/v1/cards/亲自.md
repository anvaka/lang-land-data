# **亲自 (qīn zì) - In person, personally**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 亲 (qīn): "relative," "dear," or "to parent." Left: "见 (jiàn)" radical ("to see") inside; right: "木 (mù)" ("wood") at the bottom. Carries a sense of closeness.  
- 自 (zì): "self." Pictograph: represents a nose, which one points to refer to oneself.

**Examples**:  
- 他亲自(qīn zì)去机场接她。(tā qīn zì qù jī chǎng jiē tā.) - He personally went to the airport to meet her.  
- 这封信是经理亲自(qīn zì)写的。(zhè fēng xìn shì jīng lǐ qīn zì xiě de.) - This letter was written by the manager in person.  
- 请你亲自(qīn zì)确认一下。(qǐng nǐ qīn zì què rèn yí xià.) - Please confirm in person.

**Usage Notes**:  
亲自(qīn zì) is used to emphasize that the action is done by the person personally, not delegated. Often placed before a verb.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "亲(qīn)" (close) + "自(zì)" (self) = "close by oneself" → do something yourself, personally.
