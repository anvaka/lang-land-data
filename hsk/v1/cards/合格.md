# **合格 (hé gé) - To be qualified / To meet the standard**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **合 (hé)**: "to fit; to combine." Top: "人 (rén, person)" radical; Bottom: "一 (yī, one)" beneath, and "口 (kǒu, mouth)" at the bottom, symbolizing things coming together.  
- **格 (gé)**: "standard; pattern." Left: "木 (mù, wood)" radical; Right: "各 (gè, each)" (composed of "夂 (zhǐ, go)" at the bottom and "口 (kǒu, mouth)" inside).

**Examples**:  
- 你的成绩合格了。(Nǐ de chéngjī hé gé le.) - Your grade is up to standard.  
- 他不是合格的老师。(Tā bù shì hé gé de lǎoshī.) - He is not a qualified teacher.  
- 这种产品合格吗？(Zhè zhǒng chǎnpǐn hé gé ma?) - Is this product up to standard?

**Usage Notes**:  
"合格 (hé gé)" is often used for exams, products, and people to say they meet expectations or standards. Common with "的 (de)" to describe people or things.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think "合 (hé, combine)" + "格 (gé, standard)" = "combine to the standard." If something "fits the pattern," it's "qualified."
