# **实施 (shíshī) - implement; carry out**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **实 (shí)**: Top = 宀 (mián, "roof" radical), bottom = 头 (tóu, "head"). Means "real, true, solid".  
- **施 (shī)**: Left = 方 (fāng, "square" radical), right = 也 (yě, "also"). Means "to apply, to carry out".

**Examples**:  
- 政府正在实施新政策。(Zhèngfǔ zhèngzài shíshī xīn zhèngcè.) - The government is implementing new policies.  
- 计划需要立即实施。(Jìhuà xūyào lìjí shíshī.) - The plan needs to be carried out immediately.  
- 这个项目已经开始实施。(Zhège xiàngmù yǐjīng kāishǐ shíshī.) - This project has already begun implementation.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **实施 (shíshī)** is usually for rules, policies, plans, or projects. Formal, not for daily small tasks.

**Memory Aids**:  
- **实 (shí)** = "real"; **施 (shī)** = "apply". Think: make something real by applying it-**实施 (shíshī)**!
