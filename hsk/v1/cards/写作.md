# **写作 (xiězuò) - Writing / Composition**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 写 (xiě): "to write." Top: 宀 (mián, "roof" radical, hints at enclosed space); bottom: 与 (yǔ, "to give/offer" component)-together suggests "giving words under a roof."  
- 作 (zuò): "to make/do." Left: 亻 (rén, "person" radical); right: 乍 (zhà, "suddenly"). Implies "a person suddenly acts"-to do or to make.

**Examples**:  
- 他喜欢写作。(Tā xǐhuān xiězuò.) - He likes writing.  
- 写作是一项重要的技能。(Xiězuò shì yīxiàng zhòngyào de jìnéng.) - Writing is an important skill.  
- 这篇写作很有创意。(Zhè piān xiězuò hěn yǒu chuàngyì.) - This piece of writing is very creative.

**Usage Notes**:  
写作 (xiězuò) can refer to both the act of writing and written composition, usually essays or creative writing, not casual notes.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 写 (xiě): Imagine "writing" hidden under a "roof" (宀 mián).  
- 作 (zuò): Remember the "person" (亻 rén) is "doing/making" something.  
- 写作 (xiězuò): Think "writing" + "making" = making a piece of writing!
