# **折 (zhé) - to break, fold, discount**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 折 (zhé): Left/left side is 扌(shǒu, hand radical, action), right/right side is 斤 (jīn, axe). Together: "hand" + "axe" suggests breaking or folding something by force.

**Examples**:  
- 他 把 铅笔 折 断 了。(tā bǎ qiānbǐ zhé duàn le.) - He broke the pencil.  
- 请 把 信纸 对 折。(qǐng bǎ xìnzhǐ duì zhé.) - Please fold the letter paper in half.  
- 这 本 书 打 八 折。(zhè běn shū dǎ bā zhé.) - This book is 20% off.

**Usage Notes**:  
折 (zhé) is versatile: means “to break” (usually something long), “to fold,” and in sales as a “discount” (e.g., 八折 (bā zhé): 20% off, or 80% of original price).

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine a hand (扌shǒu) holding an axe (斤 jīn) to forcibly “break” or “fold” something-that’s 折 (zhé)!
