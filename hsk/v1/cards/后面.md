# **后面 (hòumiàn) - behind; at the back**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **后** (hòu): Means "back" or "after". Top: "厂" (chǎng, cliff); bottom: "口" (kǒu, mouth).  
- **面** (miàn): Means "face", "side", or "surface". Top: "宀" (mián, roof); inside: "囬" (huí, to circle); bottom: "一" (yī, one).

**Examples**:  
- 请在我后面。(Qǐng zài wǒ hòumiàn.) - Please be behind me.  
- 教室后面有一个花园。(Jiàoshì hòumiàn yǒu yí gè huāyuán.) - There is a garden behind the classroom.  
- 车站在银行后面。(Chēzhàn zài yínháng hòumiàn.) - The station is behind the bank.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **后面** (hòumiàn) can mean physical location ("behind") or a time sequence ("afterwards") depending on context.  
- Often used with "在" (zài, at/in) to indicate position.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a "mouth" (口, kǒu) is hidden behind a "cliff" (厂, chǎng): that's **后** (hòu), meaning "behind".  
- **面** (miàn) is like a "face" or "surface"-the "side" behind (**后面**, hòumiàn) is the back side.
