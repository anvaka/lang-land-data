# **比重 (bǐ zhòng) - Proportion; Specific Gravity**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **比 (bǐ)**: "Compare." Left side: "匕 (bǐ)" (spoon/ladle), right side: second "匕 (bǐ)". Suggests comparing two similar things.  
- **重 (zhòng)**: "Heavy." Top: "千 (qiān)" (thousand), bottom: "里 (lǐ)" (a Chinese mile), indicating weight or heaviness.

**Examples**:  
- 这部分在总收入中所占的比重很大。 (Zhè bùfen zài zǒng shōurù zhōng suǒ zhàn de bǐ zhòng hěn dà.) - This part has a large proportion in the total income.  
- 女性员工的比重逐年增加。 (Nǚxìng yuángōng de bǐ zhòng zhúnián zēngjiā.) - The proportion of female employees is increasing year by year.  
- 金属的比重比水大。 (Jīnshǔ de bǐ zhòng bǐ shuǐ dà.) - The specific gravity of metal is greater than that of water.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **比重 (bǐ zhòng)** is used in both mathematics/statistics (proportion, percentage of a total) and science (specific gravity, relative density).  
- Often appears in formal or technical contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
- **比 (bǐ)**: Think "compare" - like balancing two things.  
- **重 (zhòng)**: Think "heavy" - imagine comparing which object is heavier for "proportion" or "weight ratio".
