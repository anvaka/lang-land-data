# **完成 (wánchéng) - to complete; to finish**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 完 (wán): "complete, finish." Top: 宀 (mián, "roof/radical for house") suggests shelter/home; bottom: 元 (yuán, "origin/beginning"). Together, "origin is under the roof," implying something brought to completion.  
- 成 (chéng): "to succeed, accomplish." Left: 戈 (gē, "halberd/spear"), right: 成 (chéng is also phonetic and semantic), picturing something forcefully brought to an end.

**Examples**:  
- 我完成了作业。(wǒ wánchéng le zuòyè) - I completed the homework.  
- 项目顺利完成。(xiàngmù shùnlì wánchéng) - The project was successfully completed.  
- 任务还没有完成。(rènwù hái méiyǒu wánchéng) - The task is not finished yet.

**Usage Notes**:  
完成 (wánchéng) is a verb and often takes a direct object: 完成(某事)(wánchéng mǒushì) - to complete (something). It can be used for tasks, goals, etc. Largely formal compared to 做完(zuòwán) for casual speech.

**Memory Aids**:  
完 (wán): Imagine finishing something once you’re "under the roof" (safe home).  
成 (chéng): Think of accomplishing (成) a mission (wielding the 戈 (gē), a weapon) to finish strong!
