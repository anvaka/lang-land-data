# **传授 (chuán shòu) - To impart; to pass on (knowledge/skills)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **传 (chuán)**: Left - "亻" (rén, person radical), right - "专" (zhuān, focus), originally meant "to transmit" or "to pass from person to person."  
- **授 (shòu)**: Left - "扌" (shǒu, hand radical), right - "受" (shòu, receive), combining the ideas of "handing over" and "receiving," meaning "to give" or "to teach."

**Examples**:  
- 老师 (lǎo shī) 传授 (chuán shòu) 知识 (zhī shi) 给 (gěi) 我们 (wǒ men)。 (The teacher imparts knowledge to us.)  
- 他 (tā) 愿意 (yuàn yì) 传授 (chuán shòu) 他的 (tā de) 技能 (jì néng)。 (He is willing to pass on his skills.)  
- 祖先 (zǔ xiān) 传授 (chuán shòu) 了 (le) 很多 (hěn duō) 经验 (jīng yàn)。 (The ancestors passed on a lot of experience.)

**Usage Notes**:  
传授 (chuán shòu) is often used in formal contexts, especially about knowledge, skills, or experience being taught or handed down from a higher authority (e.g., teacher to student).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 传 (chuán) as "transmitting" from person to person, and 授 (shòu) as "giving with a hand" - together, 传授 (chuán shòu) means "passing knowledge from one to another by hand."
