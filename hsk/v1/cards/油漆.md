- **油** (yóu) - oil; left: 氵(shuǐ, water radical), right: 由(yóu, cause/origin), suggesting something fluid or relating to oil.  
- **漆** (qī) - lacquer/paint; left: 氵(shuǐ, water radical), right: 桼(qī, ancient character for lacquer), referencing watery or liquid coatings.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 油漆(yóu qī) is both a noun ("paint") and verb ("to paint," mainly with a brush or roller, not for artistic painting).  
- Often refers to oil-based paint.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think: "oil"(油 yóu) + "lacquer"(漆 qī) = oil-based coating.  
- Both characters have the water radical 氵(shuǐ), hinting at something liquid.
