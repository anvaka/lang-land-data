# **想念 (xiǎngniàn) - to miss, to long for**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **想** (xiǎng): "to think, to miss." Left: **木** (mù, "wood") radical; Top-right: **目** (mù, "eye"); Bottom-right: **心** (xīn, "heart"). Together, suggests "thinking from the heart while observing."  
- **念** (niàn): "to think of, to read aloud." Top: **今** (jīn, "now"); Bottom: **心** (xīn, "heart"). Implies "what's on your mind/heart now."

**Examples**:  
- 我想念你。(Wǒ xiǎngniàn nǐ.) - I miss you.  
- 他很想念家乡。(Tā hěn xiǎngniàn jiāxiāng.) - He really misses his hometown.  
- 每次出国，我都会想念妈妈做的菜。(Měi cì chūguó, wǒ dōu huì xiǎngniàn māma zuò de cài.) - Every time I go abroad, I miss my mom’s cooking.

**Usage Notes**:  
**想念** (xiǎngniàn) is often used for people, places, or things deeply felt. More emotional and stronger than **想** (xiǎng) alone.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of **想** (xiǎng, "think/miss") + **念** (niàn, "recall/memory"): Missing someone is "thinking and remembering with the heart."
