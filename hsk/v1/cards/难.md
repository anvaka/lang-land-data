# **难 (nán) - difficult; hard; problem**

**Character Breakdown**:  
难 (nán): On the left is the radical 隹 (zhuī) meaning "short-tailed bird." On the right is 又 (yòu) meaning "again" or "hand." The combination originally related to birds and hands, but evolved to express "difficulty" or "trouble."

**Examples**:  
- 这个问题很难。(Zhè ge wèntí hěn nán.) - This question is very difficult.  
- 汉语难不难？(Hànyǔ nán bù nán?) - Is Chinese hard?  
- 这道题太难了！(Zhè dào tí tài nán le!) - This problem is too hard!

**Usage Notes**:  
难 (nán) is used as an adjective meaning "difficult." It is often used before nouns or as a predicate: 难题 (nán tí - difficult problem), 很难 (hěn nán - very hard).

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine it's "hard" (难 nán) for the "bird" (隹 zhuī, left) to use a "hand" (又 yòu, right), just like it can be "difficult" for us to solve tough problems!
