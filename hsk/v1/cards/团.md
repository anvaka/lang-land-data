# **团 (tuán) - group; organization; round**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 囗 (wéi) "enclosure" radical on the outside, symbolizing something surrounded.  
- 才 (cái) inside, originally a simplified form of "糰" (tuán), representing "roundness" or "group."

**Examples**:  
- 我们是一个团队。 (Wǒmen shì yī gè tuánduì.) - We are a team.  
- 他们组成了一个团。 (Tāmen zǔchéngle yī gè tuán.) - They formed a group.  
- 社团活动很有趣。 (Shètuán huódòng hěn yǒuqù.) - Club activities are interesting.

**Usage Notes**:  
"团" (tuán) is used for groups, organizations, or anything collective (e.g., 团队 (tuánduì) "team", 社团 (shètuán) "club", 春节团圆 (Chūnjié tuányuán) "family reunion at Spring Festival"). Also denotes roundness, especially with food (e.g., 汤圆 (tāngyuán) "glutinous rice balls").

**Memory Aids**:  
Picture "才" (cái) inside a box-like people gathered together, encircled in a group. "团" (tuán) sounds like "twine," something twisted/grouped together.
