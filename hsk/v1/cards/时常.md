# **时常 (shí cháng) - often; frequently**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **时 (shí)**: means "time"; left side is the "sun" radical (日 rì), right side is "temple" (寺 sì), indicating time's relation to the sun and ancient timekeeping.  
- **常 (cháng)**: means "often/constant"; top is "roof" radical (宀 mián), middle is "cloth" (巾 jīn), bottom is "small" (小 xiǎo) inside. It suggests things done consistently under one roof.

**Examples**:  
- 我 (wǒ) 时常 (shí cháng) 想 (xiǎng) 你 (nǐ)。 (Wǒ shí cháng xiǎng nǐ.) - I often miss you.  
- 他 (tā) 时常 (shí cháng) 迟到 (chí dào)。 (Tā shí cháng chí dào.) - He is often late.  
- 时常 (shí cháng) 休息 (xiū xī) 对 (duì) 身体 (shēn tǐ) 好 (hǎo)。 (Shí cháng xiū xī duì shēn tǐ hǎo.) - Taking breaks often is good for your health.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 时常 (shí cháng) = "often" (similar to 常常 cháng cháng or 经常 jīng cháng), but slightly more formal or literary.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Remember 时常 (shí cháng) as “time’s constant”: if something happens at all times, it happens often!  
- Imagine wearing a "time hat" (时 shí roof+sun+temple, 常 cháng roof) whenever you often do something.
