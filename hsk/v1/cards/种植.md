# **种植 (zhòng zhí) - to plant / to grow**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **种 (zhòng)**: Left: 禾 (hé, "grain," plant-related radical); Right: 中 (zhōng, "middle"). Suggests inserting something (like a seed) in the middle of grain/field-hence, "to plant."  
- **植 (zhí)**: Left: 木 (mù, "tree," plant-related radical); Right: 直 (zhí, "straight"). Literally, "to make trees stand straight"-so, "to plant."

**Examples**:  
- 我们在院子里种植(zhòng zhí)了花。(Wǒmen zài yuànzi lǐ zhòngzhí le huā.) - We planted flowers in the yard.  
- 农民种植(zhòng zhí)水稻。(Nóngmín zhòngzhí shuǐdào.) - Farmers grow rice.  
- 这种植物很难种植(zhòng zhí)。(Zhè zhǒng zhíwù hěn nán zhòngzhí.) - This kind of plant is hard to grow.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 种植(zhòng zhí) is typically used for crops, trees, or large-scale planting, not for small potted plants.  
- Often used in agricultural or botanical contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 种(zhòng) = "grain" + "middle" → put seeds in the ground.  
- 植(zhí) = "tree" + "straight" → make trees stand up in soil.  
- Think: "Planting grows straight stalks/trees."
