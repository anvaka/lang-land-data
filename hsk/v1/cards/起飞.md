# **起飞 (qǐ fēi) - to take off (of an aircraft)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **起 (qǐ)**: to rise, to start. Left: 走 (zǒu, "walk" radical) indicates movement, Right: 己 (jǐ, "self") contributes phonetics.  
- **飞 (fēi)**: to fly. Top: 飞 (fēi, "fly" radical), originally represents the shape of wings.

**Examples**:  
- 飞机起飞了。(Fēijī qǐfēi le.) - The plane has taken off.  
- 我们的航班马上起飞。(Wǒmen de hángbān mǎshàng qǐfēi.) - Our flight will take off soon.  
- 起飞时间是几点？(Qǐfēi shíjiān shì jǐ diǎn?) - What time is the takeoff?

**Usage Notes**:  
**起飞 (qǐfēi)** is mostly used for airplanes or anything that lifts off the ground vertically; rarely used for birds or people.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine **起 (qǐ)** as "getting up" and **飞 (fēi)** as "flying"-so "rise and fly" = "take off".
