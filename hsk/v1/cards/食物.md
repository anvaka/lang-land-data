# **食物 (shí wù) - Food**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 食 (shí): "to eat, food." Top: 亠 (tóu, lid/cover), bottom: 艮 (gěn, symbolizing stopping or contents). The shape suggests a container with food inside.  
- 物 (wù): "thing, object." Left: 牛 (niú, cow; radical indicating animal/thing), right: 勿 (wù, meaning "not, do not," but here just as a phonetic component).

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢中国食物。(Wǒ xǐhuān Zhōngguó shíwù.) - I like Chinese food.  
- 你带了什么食物？(Nǐ dàile shénme shíwù?) - What food did you bring?  
- 食物很新鲜。(Shíwù hěn xīnxiān.) - The food is very fresh.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 食物 (shíwù) is the general term for "food" (any kind, raw or cooked). For "cuisine" or "dishes," use 菜 (cài) or 饭菜 (fàncài).

**Memory Aids**:  
- 食 (shí) looks like a lid over food-think of a bowl of food with a cover.  
- 物 (wù): cows (牛 niú) were essential "things" for ancient farmers; think of "food" as one of the most important "things" (物 wù) in daily life.
