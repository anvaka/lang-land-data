# **可行 (kě xíng) - feasible; workable**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 可 (kě): means "can" or "may." The top has 口 (kǒu, mouth), indicating permission or ability, and the bottom is 丁 (dīng), a common surname or character, used here phonetically.  
- 行 (xíng): means "to go" or "to walk," but here, it means "to be feasible." The left side is 彳 (chì, "step" radical), and the right side is 亍 (chù), together referring to movement/action.

**Examples**:  
- 这个计划可行。(Zhè ge jì huà kě xíng.) - This plan is feasible.  
- 你的建议非常可行。(Nǐ de jiàn yì fēi cháng kě xíng.) - Your suggestion is very workable.  
- 这种方法是否可行？(Zhè zhǒng fāng fǎ shì fǒu kě xíng?) - Is this method feasible?

**Usage Notes**:  
可行 (kě xíng) is often used to judge if a proposal, plan, or method is possible to execute or realistic. Can modify with 很 (hěn, very), 非常 (fēi cháng, extremely), etc.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "可 (kě, can) + 行 (xíng, go)" - If something "can go," it means it "can work" or is "feasible."
