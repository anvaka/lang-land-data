# **音响 (yīnxiǎng) - Stereo / Speaker system**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 音 (yīn): sound, tone. The radical on the top is 立 (lì, "stand"), and the bottom is 曰 (yuē, "to say") inside a box, indicating the idea of spoken sound.  
- 响 (xiǎng): to sound, to make noise. Left side: 口 (kǒu, "mouth" radical). Right side: 向 (xiàng, "direction"), showing sound emitted in a direction.

**Examples**:  
- 我家有新的音响。(Wǒ jiā yǒu xīn de yīnxiǎng.) - My family has a new speaker system.  
- 这个音响很贵。(Zhège yīnxiǎng hěn guì.) - This stereo is very expensive.  
- 请把音响关掉。(Qǐng bǎ yīnxiǎng guān diào.) - Please turn off the speakers.

**Usage Notes**:  
音响 (yīnxiǎng) usually refers to audio equipment like speakers, sound systems, or stereos, not just any sound. Common in home and event contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
音 (yīn) = "sound"; 响 (xiǎng) = "ring/call/echo." Together, 音响 (yīnxiǎng) is where sound "rings out." Imagine turning on your 音响 (yīnxiǎng) and sound fills the room!
