# **自从 (zì cóng) - since, ever since**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **自 (zì)**: means "self" or "from." The main part resembles a nose and originally depicted a nose, which was used metaphorically for "oneself."  
- **从 (cóng)**: means "to follow" or "from." Composed of two 徵 (人 rén) radicals; the right 跟 (rén, person) follows the left, suggesting "following" or "from."

**Examples**:  
- 自从(zì cóng)我(wǒ)来了(lái le)，天气(tiān qì)变(biàn)好了(hǎo le)。  
- Since I came, the weather got better.  
- 自从(zì cóng)上大学(shàng dà xué)以后(yǐ hòu)，他(tā)很(hěn)努力(nǔ lì)。  
- Since going to university, he has worked very hard.  
- 我们(wǒ men)自从(zì cóng)去年(qù nián)没(méi)见(jiàn)过了(guo le)。  
- We haven’t met since last year.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 自从(zì cóng) is followed by a time point or event; the result is often explained in the second clause, usually with 就(jiù) or 以后(yǐ hòu).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think: "自(zì): self/from" + "从(cóng): follow/from" = "since (from when…)".  
- Imagine “since” someone starts to follow-a journey begins from that point.
