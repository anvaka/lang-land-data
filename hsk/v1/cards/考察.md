# **考察 (kǎo chá) - Inspect; investigate; examine (on-site)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **考** (kǎo): Means "to examine" or "to test." Left side is **老** (lǎo, old/elder) and right side is **丂** (kǎo, breathe out); top-bottom arrangement.  
- **察** (chá): Means "to observe" or "inspect." Top is **宀** (mián, roof), middle is **祭** (jì, sacrifice/worship), bottom is **丶** (diǎn, dot); vertically arranged.

**Examples**:  
- 老师正在考察学生的学习情况。 (Lǎoshī zhèngzài kǎochá xuéshēng de xuéxí qíngkuàng.) - The teacher is investigating the students' study progress.  
- 他们去农村考察农业发展。 (Tāmen qù nóngcūn kǎochá nóngyè fāzhǎn.) - They are going to the countryside to inspect agricultural development.

**Usage Notes**:  
**考察** (kǎochá) is often used in formal or professional contexts such as research, project evaluation, or when visiting a place to gain understanding. It implies on-site inspection, not just a theoretical exam.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of **考** (kǎo, examine) + **察** (chá, observe) as "checking carefully on-site;" both involve looking deeply into something.
