# **漏 (lòu) - to leak; to omit**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **漏** (lòu):
  - Left: **氵** (shuǐ) - "water" radical, indicating relation to liquid
  - Right, top: **屚** (lòu) - phonetic component, gives pronunciation clues and sometimes conveys meaning related to flow or opening

**Examples**:  
- 屋顶漏水了。(Wū dǐng lòu shuǐ le.) - The roof is leaking.  
- 他漏掉了一题。(Tā lòu diào le yì tí.) - He missed a question.  
- 你不能漏看这部分。(Nǐ bù néng lòu kàn zhè bù fèn.) - You can't skip this part.

**Usage Notes**:  
**漏** (lòu) is often used for physical leaks (water, air), but also for missing/omitting things (information, questions). Usually appears as a verb.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of the **氵** (shuǐ) "water" on the left meaning something related to fluid leaking out. The right side sounds like **lòu**-imagine water **lòu**king out!
