# **旧 (jiù) - old; used; former**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 旧 (jiù): The left part is 艹 (cǎo, "grass" radical), here simplified to "艹" as a component at the top left, and the right part is 日 (rì, "sun") at the right. In traditional form, 舊 (jiù), it suggests something once bright (日 rì, "sun") now covered/obscured, relating to age.

**Examples**:  
- 这本书很旧。(Zhè běn shū hěn jiù.) - This book is very old.  
- 我穿了一件旧衣服。(Wǒ chuān le yī jiàn jiù yīfu.) - I wore an old piece of clothing.  
- 他住在旧房子里。(Tā zhù zài jiù fángzi lǐ.) - He lives in an old house.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 旧 (jiù) describes things (not people) as "old," "used" or "worn." For people’s age, use 老 (lǎo).  
- Can mean "former" when used before nouns, e.g., 旧朋友 (jiù péngyǒu, old friend/former friend).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Remember 旧 (jiù): "Covered sun" means something not new, like an old sun-old, no longer bright.  
- For "old stuff," think "jiù" sounds like "you," as in "You have old things."
