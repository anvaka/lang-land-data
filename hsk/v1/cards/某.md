# **某 (mǒu) - certain; some (unspecified)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **某 (mǒu)**: At the top is “甘 (gān)” meaning "sweet," and at the bottom is “木 (mù)” meaning "wood." The character as a whole originally referred to a tree with sweet fruit, evolving in usage to mean "some person/thing" in modern Chinese.

**Examples**:  
- 请在某 (qǐng zài mǒu) 个时间到达。 (qǐng zài mǒu gè shíjiān dàodá.) - Please arrive at a certain time.  
- 某人 (mǒu rén) 偷了我的书。 (mǒu rén tōu le wǒ de shū.) - Someone stole my book.  
- 在某地 (zài mǒu dì) 发生了事故。 (zài mǒu dì fāshēng le shìgù.) - An accident happened in a certain place.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **某 (mǒu)** precedes nouns to refer to an unspecified or certain person, place, or thing (e.g., **某人 (mǒu rén)** = "someone," **某公司 (mǒu gōngsī)** = "a certain company").  
- Common in written and formal Chinese, rarely used in daily speech.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine you want to *mask* an identity, so you put "木 (mù), a wooden mask," **under** something "sweet (甘 (gān))," making it mysterious-hence, "**某 (mǒu): someone/unspecified**."
