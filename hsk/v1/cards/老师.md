# **老师 (lǎoshī) - Teacher**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 老 (lǎo): Means "old" or "honored". Radical: 耂 (lǎo, "old") on the top left, over 匕 (bǐ, "spoon") on the bottom right. Historically denotes respect.  
- 师 (shī): Means "teacher", "master". Radical: 巾 (jīn, "cloth") at the bottom, 冖 (mì, "cover") on the top, with a horizontal stroke and a small dot inside. Refers to someone with expertise.

**Examples**:  
- 他是我的老师。(Tā shì wǒ de lǎoshī.) - He is my teacher.  
- 老师好！(Lǎoshī hǎo!) - Hello, teacher!  
- 你喜欢你的老师吗？(Nǐ xǐhuān nǐ de lǎoshī ma?) - Do you like your teacher?

**Usage Notes**:  
老师 (lǎoshī) can be used for both male and female teachers. It can be used as a title: 王老师 (Wáng lǎoshī, "Teacher Wang").

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: A 老 (lǎo, "wise/old") person becomes a 师 (shī, "master"), so a teacher is a combination of "honored" and "master".
