- 口 (kǒu) - mouth. Simple square shape depicting an open mouth.  
- 腔 (qiāng) - cavity, chamber. Left: 月 (yuè, actually "flesh" radical) referring to the body; Right: 空 (kōng, hollow, with "roof" on top, "work" in the middle, and "legs" at the bottom), representing an empty space.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 口 (kǒu, mouth) + 腔 (qiāng, chamber)- your mouth is a “chamber” in your body!
