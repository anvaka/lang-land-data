# **个性 (gè xìng) - Personality**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 个 (gè): "Individual" or "single." Composed of 亻(rén, person radical) on the left and 丿 (piě) on the right. Suggests an individual person.  
- 性 (xìng): "Nature," "character," or "gender." Left is 忄(xīn, heart radical), right is 生 (shēng, birth/life). Suggests qualities from the heart.

**Examples**:  
- 他有很强的个性。(Tā yǒu hěn qiáng de gèxìng.) - He has a strong personality.  
- 每个人的个性都不同。(Měi gè rén de gèxìng dōu bù tóng.) - Everyone's personality is different.

**Usage Notes**:  
个性 (gèxìng) often describes someone's unique or distinctive personality. Used in both positive and neutral contexts. Not to be confused with 性格 (xìnggé), which also means "character/personality" but emphasizes temperament.

**Memory Aids**:
