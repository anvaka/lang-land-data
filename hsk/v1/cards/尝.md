# **尝 (cháng) - to taste; to try**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 尝 (cháng): On top is the "⺖" (xiōng; phonetic component, altered from "尚" shàng), suggesting pronunciation. At the bottom, there’s the "小" (xiǎo; small), sometimes interpreted as "mouth" (with tasting). The "小" (xiǎo) at the bottom hints at the action "to taste" (with the mouth).

**Examples**:  
- 请尝一尝这个汤。(Qǐng cháng yī cháng zhège tāng.) - Please taste this soup.  
- 我没尝过这种水果。(Wǒ méi cháng guò zhè zhǒng shuǐguǒ.) - I haven't tried this kind of fruit.  
- 他想尝试新菜式。(Tā xiǎng cháng shì xīn càishì.) - He wants to try new dishes.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 尝 (cháng) means to taste (food/drinks) or try something briefly. For general "try," use 尝试 (cháng shì) or 试 (shì).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think: "Taste with a small (小 xiǎo) mouth" underneath a "roof," showing someone sampling food under a shelter.  
- "常" (cháng; often) is pronounced the same-if you taste things often, you are always trying!
