**Usage Notes**:  
- 硕士 (shuòshì) refers both to the academic degree and someone who holds it.  
- Used in educational and formal contexts, usually after completing a 学士 (xuéshì, "bachelor's").

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think of 硕 (shuò, "large") + 士 (shì, "scholar") = a "great scholar" → master's degree.  
- 石 (shí, "stone") radical in 硕 (shuò) hints at a strong, solid foundation in learning.
