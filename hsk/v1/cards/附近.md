# **附近 (fùjìn) - nearby; vicinity**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **附** (fù): *to be close to, to attach*. Left: **阝** (fù, mound radical), right: **付** (fù, to pay/hand over).  
- **近** (jìn): *near*. Left: **辶** (chuò, movement/walking radical), right: **斤** (jīn, axe/unit of weight).

**Examples**:  
- 你住在附近吗？(Nǐ zhù zài fùjìn ma?) - Do you live nearby?

- 学校附近很安静。(Xuéxiào fùjìn hěn ānjìng.) - The area near the school is quiet.

**Usage Notes**:  
**附近** (fùjìn) works as a noun or adverb, meaning "nearby" or "vicinity." It is often used after a place word, e.g. **我家附近** (wǒ jiā fùjìn).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think "**附** (fù)" as "attached to" and "**近** (jìn)" as "near" - so **附近** (fùjìn) means "attached and near," i.e., in the vicinity.
