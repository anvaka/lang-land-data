# **责怪 (zéguài) - to blame**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **责** (zé): means "to reproach; to blame." Left side is 贝 (bèi, shell/money) and right side is 朿 (cì, thorn - here as a phonetic component).  
- **怪** (guài): means "to blame; strange." Left side is 忄 (xīn, heart radical, on the left), right side is 圣 (shèng, sage/wise) on the right.

**Examples**:  
- 不要责怪(zéguài)自己。(Bùyào zéguài zìjǐ.) - Don't blame yourself.  
- 他常常责怪(zéguài)别人。(Tā chángcháng zéguài biérén.) - He often blames others.  
- 老师没有责怪(zéguài)我迟到。(Lǎoshī méiyǒu zéguài wǒ chídào.) - The teacher didn't blame me for being late.

**Usage Notes**:  
责怪(zéguài) is often used with a person as the object. It is more formal than the spoken 说(shuō, to tell off) or 怪(guài, to blame/complain).

**Memory Aids**:  
责(zé) looks like someone holding currency (贝, bèi) and "thorns" (朿, cì) as punishment-they're being blamed! 怪(guài) links "heart" (忄, xīn) with a "sage" (圣, shèng): feeling strange or blaming in your heart.
