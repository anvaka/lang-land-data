**Usage Notes**:  
- **至少 (zhì shǎo)** is typically placed before the quantity or verb it modifies.  
- Used for making minimum estimates or expressing minimum requirements.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine you “arrive” (至 zhì) at the “smallest” (少 shǎo) possible amount-at least this much!  
- “至 (zhì)” = to; “少 (shǎo)” = few → “to the fewest” = at least.
