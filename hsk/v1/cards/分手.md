# **分手 (fēnshǒu) - to break up**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **分** (fēn) - "to divide, separate". At the **top**, two dots represent "knife" (刂, dāo), and at the **bottom**, it looks like an upside-down "八" (bā), suggesting separation.  
- **手** (shǒu) - "hand". The **top** bars look like fingers, and the **bottom** box with a line through it mimics a palm.

**Examples**:  
- 我们分手了。(Wǒmen fēnshǒu le.) - We broke up.  
- 他们决定分手。(Tāmen juédìng fēnshǒu.) - They decided to break up.  
- 分手后，他很伤心。(Fēnshǒu hòu, tā hěn shāngxīn.) - After breaking up, he was very sad.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **分手** (fēnshǒu) is most often used for ending romantic relationships, but can also describe friends parting ways.  
- Verb-object structure: commonly followed by 了(le) or 以后(yǐhòu) for past actions/events.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine two **hands** (**手** (shǒu)) that were together now **dividing** (**分** (fēn)), representing a breakup.  
- Think: "Split hands" = no longer together.
