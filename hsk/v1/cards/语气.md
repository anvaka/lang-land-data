# **语气 (yǔqì) - Tone / Manner of Speaking**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 语 (yǔ): “speech/language”
  - Radical: 讠(yán) "speech" (left), component: 吾(wú) (right)  
- 气 (qì): “air, breath, energy”
  - Radical and whole: "steam"

**Examples**:  
- 你的语气 (nǐ de yǔqì) 很严厉 (hěn yánlì)。- Your tone is very harsh.  
- 请注意 (qǐng zhùyì) 语气 (yǔqì)。- Please pay attention to your tone.  
- 她用友好的语气 (tā yòng yǒuhǎo de yǔqì) 说话 (shuōhuà)。- She spoke in a friendly tone.

**Usage Notes**:  
语气 (yǔqì) refers to how something is said, not what is said. Often used with verbs like 注意 (zhùyì, "pay attention to"), 改变 (gǎibiàn, "change"), or strong adjectives.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: 语 (yǔ) “language” + 气 (qì) “air”-your "language air" is how your words come out, reflecting your mood or attitude.
