# **敢 (gǎn) - to dare; to have the courage**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 敢 (gǎn): Radical on the left is 攵 (pū), meaning "to tap" or "strike". The right/top part is the phonetic component, combining elements from 甘 (gān, "sweet") and 又 (yòu, "again") at the bottom. The structure suggests action, determination, and effort.

**Examples**:  
- 我敢问你一个问题。(Wǒ gǎn wèn nǐ yí gè wèntí.) - I dare to ask you a question.  
- 他不敢跳下来。(Tā bù gǎn tiào xiàlái.) - He doesn't dare to jump down.  
- 你敢试试吗？(Nǐ gǎn shìshi ma?) - Do you dare to try?

**Usage Notes**:  
敢 (gǎn) is often followed by another verb (e.g., 敢说 (gǎn shuō), 敢做 (gǎn zuò)), usually to express willingness or courage to do something. It’s typically negated with 不 (bù).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 敢 (gǎn) as having the "strike" (攵 (pū)) of courage with the sweetness (甘 (gān)) of success inside-courage is taking action for a "sweet" result!
