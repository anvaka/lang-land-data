# **传染 (chuán rǎn) - Infect / Infection**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **传 (chuán)**: "to transmit, pass on". Left: "亻" (rén, person) radical, right: "专" (zhuān, specialized). Suggests someone passing or transmitting something.  
- **染 (rǎn)**: "to dye, infect". Top: "氵" (shuǐ, water) radical, bottom right: "九" (jiǔ, nine) inside "木" (mù, wood) on the left. Originally meant dipping wood in water to dye it, now also means "to be infected".

**Examples**:  
- 这种病毒很容易传染。(Zhè zhǒng bìngdú hěn róngyì chuánrǎn.) - This virus is very easily transmitted.  
- 他传染了感冒给我。(Tā chuánrǎn le gǎnmào gěi wǒ.) - He passed a cold to me.  
- 传染病需要隔离。(Chuánrǎnbìng xūyào gélí.) - Infectious diseases need isolation.

**Usage Notes**:  
"传染 (chuánrǎn)" is often used with diseases. Can be a verb ("to infect") or noun ("infection"). E.g., "被传染 (bèi chuánrǎn)" = "be infected", "传染性 (chuánrǎnxìng)" = "infectiousness".

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine a person (亻 rén) sending something specialized (专 zhuān) that spreads (传 chuán) and touches like water (氵 shuǐ) dyeing wood (木 mù)-just as germs spread infection.
