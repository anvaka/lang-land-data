# **那 (nà) - that**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 那 (nà): On the left is the radical 邑 (yì) ("city/town"), combining 阝 (fù, city radical, left side) with the right-side component resembling 冄 (rǎn, meaning "soft/gradual"). Together, 那 (nà) originally indicated a name of a place, but now means "that".

**Examples**:  
- 那是我的书。(Nà shì wǒ de shū.) - That is my book.  
- 你认识那个人吗？(Nǐ rènshi nà gè rén ma?) - Do you know that person?  
- 那里的天气很好。(Nàlǐ de tiānqì hěn hǎo.) - The weather there is very good.

**Usage Notes**:  
那 (nà) commonly points to something far from the speaker, often used before measure words and nouns. In questions, 那 (nà) can also mean "in that case".

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine 那 (nà) as a city (left) with something out *there* on the right-so it's always *that* thing over there!
