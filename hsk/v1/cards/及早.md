# **及早 (jí zǎo) - as soon as possible; at an early date**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **及 (jí)**: means "to reach" or "to catch up." The left side is the "person" radical (亻(rén)) on the left, the right side is 及 (jí) itself.  
- **早 (zǎo)**: means "early." The top is the "sun" radical (日(rì)), the bottom is 十(shí), resembling "ten," hinting at early morning.

**Examples**:  
- 我们要及早(jí zǎo)准备。(Wǒmen yào jí zǎo zhǔnbèi.) - We should prepare as early as possible.  
- 请及早(jí zǎo)通知我。(Qǐng jí zǎo tōngzhī wǒ.) - Please inform me as soon as possible.  
- 及早(jí zǎo)预防很重要。(Jí zǎo yùfáng hěn zhòngyào.) - Early prevention is very important.

**Usage Notes**:  
及早(jí zǎo) is used as an adverb before verbs to stress acting sooner rather than later, especially to avoid problems.

**Memory Aids**:  
"及 (jí)" means "to reach," "早 (zǎo)" means "early"-so to reach early = do something ASAP.
