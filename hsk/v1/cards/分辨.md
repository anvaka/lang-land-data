# **分辨 (fēnbiàn) - distinguish; differentiate**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **分 (fēn)**: Means "divide" or "separate." Top: "⺁" (knife, cutting/dividing action), Bottom: "八" (split/divide).  
- **辨 (biàn)**: Means "distinguish." Left: "言 (yán)" (speech, left side gives idea of 'discussion'), Right: "⺈" (knife, under speech indicating careful examination or discernment).

**Examples**:  
- 很难分辨 (hěn nán fēnbiàn) - It's hard to tell the difference.  
- 我分辨不出真假 (wǒ fēnbiàn bù chū zhēn jiǎ) - I can't distinguish between real and fake.  
- 请分辨这些声音 (qǐng fēnbiàn zhèxiē shēngyīn) - Please differentiate these sounds.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 分辨 (fēnbiàn) usually takes a direct object: 分辨 色彩 (fēnbiàn sècǎi) - To distinguish colors.  
- Often used for sensory or intellectual distinctions-appearance, sounds, truth, etc.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 分 (fēn) like "split," 辨 (biàn) has "speech (言 yán)" and "knife"-so imagine you "cut" and "analyze with words" to tell things apart.
