# **汉语 (hànyǔ) - Chinese language**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **汉** (hàn): Means "Han," referring to the Han ethnic group. Left: "氵" (shuǐ, water radical) indicates relation to water; right: "又" (yòu, again/hand shape).  
- **语** (yǔ): Means "language, speech." Left: "讠" (yán, speech radical), right: "吾" (wú, I/me).

**Examples**:  
- 你会说汉语吗？(nǐ huì shuō hànyǔ ma?) - Can you speak Chinese?  
- 汉语很有意思。(hànyǔ hěn yǒu yìsi.) - Chinese is very interesting.  
- 我在学习汉语。(wǒ zài xuéxí hànyǔ.) - I am learning Chinese.

**Usage Notes**:  
**汉语** (hànyǔ) usually refers to spoken Mandarin Chinese. For "Chinese language" in a national or written sense, use **中文** (zhōngwén).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of **汉** (hàn) = "Han people" and **语** (yǔ) = "language"; so **汉语** (hànyǔ) is the "language of the Han people."
