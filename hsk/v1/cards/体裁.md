# **体裁 (tǐcái) - Genre; Literary form**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **体 (tǐ)**: "Body," "form." Left: 亻(human radical); right: 本(root/base) on bottom.  
- **裁 (cái)**: "Cut," "judge," "decide." Top: 衤(clothes radical) on left; right: 剪(scissors/knife) on top right.

**Examples**:  
- 这部小说的体裁(tǐcái)是科幻。(Zhè bù xiǎoshuō de tǐcái shì kēhuàn.) - The genre of this novel is science fiction.  
- 你喜欢哪种体裁(tǐcái)的音乐？(Nǐ xǐhuān nǎ zhǒng tǐcái de yīnyuè?) - What genre of music do you like?  
- 诗歌是一种特别的体裁(tǐcái)。(Shīgē shì yī zhǒng tèbié de tǐcái.) - Poetry is a special literary form.

**Usage Notes**:  
体裁(tǐcái) is most commonly used to describe types of literature, art, or music (e.g., prose, poetry, essay style), not for physical forms.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 体(tǐ) as the "body" (form/structure) and 裁(cái) as "cutting out" (selection), so 体裁(tǐcái) is the way a work "takes shape" or is "cut/formatted."
