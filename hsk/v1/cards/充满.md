# **充满 (chōng mǎn) - to be full of; to fill**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 充 (chōng): "to fill," "to supply." Top: 亠 (tóu, lid radical, "cover"); middle: 儿 (ér, "child"); bottom: 一 (yī, "one"). Suggests something being covered or filled up.  
- 满 (mǎn): "full." Left: 氵 (shuǐ, three-dots water radical, "water"); right: 满 (mǎn) component 㒼 inside and two dots (indicating full or abundance). Signifies water filling up-fullness.

**Examples**:  
- 房间 (fáng jiān) 充满 (chōng mǎn) 笑声 (xiào shēng)。 (Fángjiān chōngmǎn xiàoshēng.) - The room is full of laughter.  
- 他 (tā) 充满 (chōng mǎn) 自信 (zì xìn)。 (Tā chōngmǎn zìxìn.) - He is full of confidence.  
- 这个 (zhè ge) 杯子 (bēi zi) 充满 (chōng mǎn) 了 (le) 水 (shuǐ)。 (Zhège bēizi chōngmǎn le shuǐ.) - This cup is filled with water.

**Usage Notes**:  
充满 (chōng mǎn) is used with abstract (e.g., emotions) or concrete (e.g., objects) nouns. Often followed by what is being filled with (充满 (chōng mǎn) + noun).

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine pouring water (氵 (shuǐ)) in until it's completely covered (亠 (tóu)), so it's “full” (充满 (chōng mǎn)). 充 (chōng) is like charging (filling up) and 满 (mǎn) means full!
