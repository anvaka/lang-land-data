# **关系 (guānxi) - relationship; connection; relevance**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **关** (guān): Means "close" or "shut". Left: "门" (mén) radical (door) on the outside, inside: "𦣻" (a phonetic and meaning component).  
- **系** (xì): Means "tie", "system", or "department". Top: "糸" (mì, silk/thread) radical, bottom: "丿" (piě, stroke component).

**Examples**:  
- 我跟他没有关系。(Wǒ gēn tā méiyǒu guānxi.) - I have no relationship with him.  
- 这跟你有什么关系？(Zhè gēn nǐ yǒu shénme guānxi?) - What does this have to do with you?  
- 他们关系很好。(Tāmen guānxi hěn hǎo.) - Their relationship is very good.

**Usage Notes**:  
**关系** (guānxi) is widely used for "relationship" (between people, things, or ideas) and "connection" (social ties). Also means "relevance" or "concern" depending on context.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of **关** (guān) as "closing the door" (forming boundaries), and **系** (xì) as "threads" tying things together-so **关系** (guānxi) links or connects people or things.
