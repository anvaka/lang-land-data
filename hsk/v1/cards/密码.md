- **秘 (mì)**: "secret". Left: 禾 (hé, "grain"), right: 必 (bì, "certainly"). Often means secret or confidential.  
- **码 (mǎ)**: "code; number". Left: 码 (mǎ, "code", contains 石 (shí, "stone") on the left and 马 (mǎ, "horse") on the right), used for codes/numbers.

- 我的密码很长。(Wǒ de mìmǎ hěn cháng.) - My password is very long.  
- 你忘记密码了吗？(Nǐ wàngjì mìmǎ le ma?) - Did you forget the password?

**Usage Notes**:  
密码 (mìmǎ) is commonly used for digital accounts and security locks. Often followed by 输入 (shūrù, "enter") or 设置 (shèzhì, "set").

**Memory Aids**:  
“秘 (mì)” is a "secret"; “码 (mǎ)” is a "code". So, 密码 (mìmǎ) = "secret code" → password!
