# **之 (zhī) - to, of, him/her/it (literary)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 之 (zhī): A simple pictograph, originally depicting a foot; evolved to mean "to go" → function word. It has no radical components, but is written with a short stroke left (top) and longer strokes right and bottom.

**Examples**:  
- 取之不尽 (qǔ zhī bù jìn) - An endless supply  
- 言之有理 (yán zhī yǒu lǐ) - What is said makes sense  
- 前事不忘，后事之师 (qián shì bù wàng, hòu shì zhī shī) - Past experiences guide the future

**Usage Notes**:  
- Used mostly in Classical Chinese, can replace 他/她/它 (tā) as "him/her/it," or indicate possession like 的 (de): e.g. “人生之路 (rén shēng zhī lù)” = "the road of life". Rare in spoken Modern Chinese.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 之 (zhī) looks like a person moving forward-imagine “going to” something or a possessive arrow "of" something.
