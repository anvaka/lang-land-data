# **显著 (xiǎnzhù) - Significant; Remarkable**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **显** (xiǎn): "to show, apparent"
  - Radical: 日 (rì, "sun/day") at the top + 见 (jiàn, "see") at the bottom.  
- **著** (zhù): "to be conspicuous, notable"
  - Radical: 艹 (cǎo, "grass") on top + 者 (zhě, "person/thing") below.

**Examples**:  
- 成绩显著 (chéngjì xiǎnzhù) - The results are remarkable.  
- 他的进步很显著 (tā de jìnbù hěn xiǎnzhù) - His progress is very noticeable.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **显著** (xiǎnzhù) is mostly used to describe positive, obvious, or measurable changes, progress, or differences.  
- Functions as an adjective before nouns or after "很" (hěn, "very").

**Memory Aids**:  
- **显** (xiǎn) looks like the "sun" (日, rì) shining on someone to make them "seen" (见, jiàn).  
- **著** (zhù): When something is “growing” (艹, cǎo) out and a “person” (者, zhě) is noticed, it must be remarkable!
