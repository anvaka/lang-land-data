# **薄 (bó) - thin; light; weak**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **薄** (bó): Top: 艹 (cǎo, "grass" radical); Middle: 溥 (pǔ, meaning "spread"); Bottom: 水 (shuǐ, water dots in old forms-now simplified dashes). Indicates something spread thin, like grass or a sheet.

**Examples**:  
- 这本书太薄 (Zhè běn shū tài bó) - This book is too thin.  
- 空气变得很薄 (Kōngqì biàn dé hěn bó) - The air becomes very thin.  
- 他的感情很薄 (Tā de gǎnqíng hěn bó) - His feelings are shallow.

**Usage Notes**:  
**薄** (bó) is usually used to describe objects, layers, air, or feelings that are physically or metaphorically "thin" or "light."

**Memory Aids**:  
Remember the 艹 (cǎo, "grass") on top: imagine a thin layer of grass spread thinly over the ground-just as **薄** (bó) means "thin" or "spread out."
