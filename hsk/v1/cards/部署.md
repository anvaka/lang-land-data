# **部署 (bù shǔ) - to deploy; deployment**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 部 (bù): "part; section." Left: 阝(fù) "mound" radical (often locality); right: 咅(pǒu) - "to speak."  
- 署 (shǔ): "office; arrange." Top: 者(zhě) "person;" bottom: 罒(wǎng) "net," representing administration or arrangement.

**Examples**:  
- 我们需要部署(bù shǔ)新的系统。(Wǒmen xūyào bùshǔ xīn de xìtǒng.) - We need to deploy a new system.  
- 计划已经部署(bù shǔ)好了。(Jìhuà yǐjīng bùshǔ hǎo le.) - The plan has already been deployed.  
- 部队正在部署(bù shǔ)。(Bùduì zhèngzài bùshǔ.) - The troops are being deployed.

**Usage Notes**:  
部署(bù shǔ) is formal, used for systematic arrangement-often in military, tech, or project settings.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine 部(bù) as a "section" being assigned, and 署(shǔ) as an "office" arranging the placement-together: arranging sections = deploy.
