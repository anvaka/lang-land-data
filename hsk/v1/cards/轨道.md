# **轨道 (guǐdào) - Track; Orbit; Rail**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **轨 (guǐ)**: "rail, track." Left: "车 (chē)" - vehicle radical. Right: "九 (jiǔ)" - nine, phonetic. Think: rails for vehicles.  
- **道 (dào)**: "way, path." Left: "辶 (chuò)" - walk/movement radical at bottom. Right: "首 (shǒu)" - head, phonetic. Path where things move/go.

**Examples**:  
- 火车在轨道上运行。(Huǒchē zài guǐdào shàng yùnxíng.) - The train runs on the tracks.  
- 地球绕着太阳的轨道转。(Dìqiú rào zhe tàiyáng de guǐdào zhuàn.) - The Earth revolves around the Sun's orbit.  
- 卫星脱离了原来的轨道。(Wèixīng tuōlíle yuánlái de guǐdào.) - The satellite left its original orbit.

**Usage Notes**:  
**轨道 (guǐdào)** is used for physical tracks (railways) and also metaphorically for orbits, trajectories, or proper course.

**Memory Aids**:  
**轨 (guǐ)** = "car (车 chē) on rails."  
**道 (dào)** = "movement (辶 chuò) + head (首 shǒu)"-leads the way.  
Picture a path for trains or planets to follow.
