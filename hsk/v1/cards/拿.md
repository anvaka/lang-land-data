# **拿 (ná) - to take, to hold**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **拿** (ná): The top is **合** (hé, "to close, combine"), and the bottom is **手** (shǒu, "hand", in a compact form). Together, this suggests "using the hand to hold or take something."

**Examples**:  
- 请把书拿给我。 (qǐng bǎ shū ná gěi wǒ.) - Please hand the book to me.  
- 他用手拿着杯子。 (tā yòng shǒu ná zhe bēizi.) - He is holding a cup in his hand.  
- 你能帮我拿一下吗？ (nǐ néng bāng wǒ ná yíxià ma?) - Can you help me hold this?

**Usage Notes**:  
- **拿** (ná) is often used for physically **holding**, **grabbing**, or **taking** objects with your hand.  
- Combine with objects or pronouns, e.g., **拿出来** (ná chūlái, "take out"), **拿去** (ná qù, "take away").

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a **hand** (手 shǒu) **combining** (合 hé) with something on top-you're using your hand to **take** or **hold** an object.
