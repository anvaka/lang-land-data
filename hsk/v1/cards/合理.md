# **合理 (hé lǐ) - reasonable; rational**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **合 (hé)**: "to fit, to combine." Left/right arrangement-left is "人 (rén)" (person), right is "口 (kǒu)" (mouth). Suggests people coming together and speaking in agreement.  
- **理 (lǐ)**: "reason, logic." Left/right arrangement-left is "王 (wáng)" (jade/king, representing value), right is "里 (lǐ)" (inside/village), together suggesting valuable logic within.

**Examples**:  
- 这个价格很合理。(Zhè ge jiàgé hěn hé lǐ.) - This price is reasonable.  
- 你的解释不太合理。(Nǐ de jiěshì bú tài hé lǐ.) - Your explanation is not very reasonable.  
- 我们需要一个合理的计划。(Wǒmen xūyào yí gè hé lǐ de jìhuà.) - We need a reasonable plan.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **合理 (hé lǐ)** is used to describe thoughts, actions, plans, and things that make sense or are justified.  
- Common structures: 合理的 (hé lǐ de) + noun; 不合理 (bù hé lǐ) = unreasonable.

**Memory Aids**:  
- **合 (hé)** is like "to fit together," and **理 (lǐ)** is "reasoning." If things "fit together with reason," they are **合理 (hé lǐ)**!
