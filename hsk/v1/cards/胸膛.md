# **胸膛 (xiōng táng) - Chest; Breast (noun)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **胸** (xiōng): Top is "⺼" (meat/flesh radical, variant of "月", on the left), indicating body part; right is "匈" (xiōng), phonetic. Means "chest, thorax, breast."  
- **膛** (táng): Left "⺼" (meat/flesh radical), right "堂" (táng, means "hall", phonetic). Refers to internal cavity/space, commonly body cavity.

**Examples**:  
- 他把手放在胸膛。(Tā bǎ shǒu fàng zài xiōng táng.) - He put his hand on his chest.  
- 她的胸膛起伏着。(Tā de xiōng táng qǐ fú zhe.) - Her chest was rising and falling.  
- 心跳在胸膛里加速。(Xīn tiào zài xiōng táng lǐ jiā sù.) - The heartbeat sped up in the chest.

**Usage Notes**:  
"胸膛" (xiōng táng) is more anatomical or literary than "胸部" (xiōng bù). Used in writing, poetry, or to evoke emotion/strength.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine "胸" (xiōng) is the front of your "meaty" (⺼) body, and "膛" (táng) is a "hall" (堂) inside-your chest as the great hall of your body.
