# **魔鬼 (mó guǐ) - Devil; Demon**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 魔 (mó): "Demon; evil spirit." Top: 广 (guǎng, "shelter"; radical); Inside: 麻 (má) meaning "hemp" (suggests complexity/chaos).  
- 鬼 (guǐ): "Ghost; spirit." Top: 田 (tián, "field"); Bottom: 儿 (ér, "legs/claws"); suggests a lurking, ghostly figure.

**Examples**:  
- 他像魔鬼一样狡猾。(Tā xiàng móguǐ yīyàng jiǎohuá.) - He is as cunning as a devil.  
- 传说中有很多魔鬼。(Chuánshuō zhōng yǒu hěn duō móguǐ.) - There are many devils in legends.  
- 孩子们害怕魔鬼。(Háizimen hàipà móguǐ.) - The children are afraid of devils.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 魔鬼 (móguǐ) is often used metaphorically for an evil or fiendish person, not just the supernatural.  
- Common in stories, expressions, and figurative language.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 魔 (mó) has the same radical as "magic" (魔法, mófǎ)-think "magic" and "devil" are both mysterious.  
- 鬼 (guǐ) looks like a haunted face with legs-think "ghost/devil on the move."
