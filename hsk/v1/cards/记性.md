# **记性 (jì xìng) - Memory; ability to remember**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **记 (jì)**: Means "to remember" or "to record." Left side is 讠(yán), the "speech" radical, and right side is 己(jǐ), meaning "oneself."  
- **性 (xìng)**: Means "nature," "characteristic," or "-ness." Left side is 忄(xīn), the "heart" radical, right side is 生(shēng), meaning "life" or "birth."

**Examples**:  
- 他的记性(jì xìng)很好。(Tā de jì xìng hěn hǎo.) - His memory is very good.  
- 我最近记性(jì xìng)不好。(Wǒ zuì jìn jì xìng bù hǎo.) - My memory has been poor lately.  
- 小孩的记性(jì xìng)很快。(Xiǎo hái de jì xìng hěn kuài.) - Children memorize things quickly.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 记性(jì xìng) is usually used to talk about someone's memory ability (good or bad).  
- Common with 好(hǎo) (good) or 差(chà) (poor).  
- Used informally in daily conversation.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 记(jì) includes 己(jǐ), so it's "recording oneself"-remembering.  
- 性(xìng) has 忄(xīn), the heart, so memory is a characteristic from the heart/mind.
