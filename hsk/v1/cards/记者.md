# **记者 (jì zhě) - Journalist/Reporter**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **记 (jì)**: means "to record" or "to remember."
  - Left: 讠(yán) radical, meaning "speech" (on the left).
  - Right: 己(jǐ), "oneself" (on the right).  
- **者 (zhě)**: means "person who…" or "-er" (indicates an agent or someone who does something).
  - Top: 耂 (lǎo), old/elder (variant).
  - Bottom: 日 (rì), "sun" or "day", (at the bottom).

**Examples**:  
- 他是一个记者。(Tā shì yí gè jì zhě.) - He is a journalist.  
- 记者正在采访明星。(Jì zhě zhèng zài cǎi fǎng míng xīng.) - The reporter is interviewing a celebrity.  
- 记者写了这篇报道。(Jì zhě xiě le zhè piān bào dào.) - The reporter wrote this article.

**Usage Notes**:  
记者 (jì zhě) is used for both print and broadcast reporters. Attach 工作 (gōng zuò, "job") or 采访 (cǎi fǎng, "interview") to talk about a reporter's work.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: 记 (jì) "record" + 者 (zhě) "person" = "person who records" → reporter. 记(jì) is about writing or remembering; 者(zhě) is often used for professions.
