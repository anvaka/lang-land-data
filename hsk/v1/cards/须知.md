# **须知 (xū zhī) - Notice; Points to Note; Important Information**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 须 (xū): Means “must” or "need to." The top is 彡(shān) meaning “hair”, the bottom is 页(yè) meaning “page/head.”  
- 知 (zhī): Means “know.” The left is 矢(shǐ) “arrow”, the right is 口(kǒu) “mouth”-literally "to know/speak like an arrow."

**Examples**:  
- 请阅读以下须知。(Qǐng yuèdú yǐxià xūzhī.) - Please read the following notice.  
- 这是重要须知。(Zhè shì zhòngyào xūzhī.) - This is important information.  
- 新员工须知在这里。(Xīn yuángōng xūzhī zài zhèlǐ.) - The notice for new employees is here.

**Usage Notes**:  
须知 (xūzhī) is formal, often used in written signs, manuals, or at the start of instructions. It’s rarely used in everyday speech.

**Memory Aids**:  
须 (xū) "must" + 知 (zhī) "know" = “things you must know.”  
Imagine "hair" (须, xū) standing on end because the information (知, zhī) is so important!
