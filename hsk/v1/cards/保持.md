# **保持 (bǎo chí) - to maintain; to keep**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **保 (bǎo)**: Left-**亻** (rén) "person" radical; right-**呆** (dāi) means "stupid" but here acts phonetically. Together: A person "protecting" or "guarding".  
- **持 (chí)**: Left-**扌** (shǒu) "hand" radical; right-**寺** (sì) "temple". Idea: a "hand" holding or "maintaining" something.

**Examples**:  
- 请保持安静。(Qǐng bǎo chí ān jìng.) - Please keep quiet.  
- 保持联系。(Bǎo chí lián xì.) - Keep in touch.  
- 保持健康很重要。(Bǎo chí jiàn kāng hěn zhòng yào.) - Maintaining health is important.

**Usage Notes**:  
**保持 (bǎo chí)** is often used with abstract nouns (e.g., peace, calmness, health). Usually followed by a noun, not a verb.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: Use your "hand" (扌 (shǒu)) to "protect" (保 (bǎo)) and "maintain" (持 (chí)) what matters-like keeping a promise or situation unchanged.
