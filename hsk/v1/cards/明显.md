# **明显 (míngxiǎn) - obvious; clear**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 明 (míng): Left side is 日 (rì, sun); right side is 月 (yuè, moon). Together, they suggest "bright" or "clear".  
- 显 (xiǎn): Top is 日 (rì, sun); bottom is 业 (yè, business/profession component), together meaning "to appear," "evident," or "prominent".

**Examples**:  
- 这个错误很明显。(Zhège cuòwù hěn míngxiǎn.) - This mistake is very obvious.  
- 他有明显的进步。(Tā yǒu míngxiǎn de jìnbù.) - He has obvious progress.  
- 这个标志很明显。(Zhège biāozhì hěn míngxiǎn.) - This sign is very clear.

**Usage Notes**:  
明显 (míngxiǎn) is most often used as an adjective for things that are easy to see, recognize, or detect. It’s common before a noun (明显的 míngxiǎn de) or after 很 (hěn).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think about 明 (míng, bright/clear)-when the sun and moon are out, things are easy to see (clear/obvious). Add 显 (xiǎn, appear), and it’s something that appears bright-so it’s obvious!
