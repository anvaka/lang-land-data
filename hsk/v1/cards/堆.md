# **堆 (duī) - pile; heap; stack**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **堆** (duī): Left side is 土 (tǔ, "earth/soil" radical), indicating relation to ground or material. Right side is 隹 (zhuī, "short-tailed bird"), often used for phonetic purposes and appears vertically on the right.

**Examples**:  
- 桌子上有一堆书。(Zhuōzi shàng yǒu yī duī shū.) - There is a pile of books on the table.  
- 雪人是用雪堆起来的。(Xuěrén shì yòng xuě duī qǐlái de.) - The snowman is made by piling up snow.  
- 他把衣服堆在床上。(Tā bǎ yīfu duī zài chuáng shàng.) - He piled the clothes on the bed.

**Usage Notes**:  
**堆** (duī) is both a noun (a pile) and a verb (to pile up). Can be used for physical objects (books, clothes) or abstract things (a heap of problems).

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine birds (**隹** (zhuī)) on top of soil (**土** (tǔ)), forming a "pile" or "heap" together.
