# **陷害 (xiàn hài) - To frame; to entrap (someone)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **陷** (xiàn): "to trap, pit, sink." Left: "阝" (fù, mound), often related to land; right: "臽" (xiàn), depicting a pit with a mouth on top and two lines below, suggesting a hole or trap.  
- **害** (hài): "to harm." Top: "宀" (mián, roof/cover); inside: "口" (kǒu, mouth) and "丰" (fēng, abundant). Originally meant "calamity under a roof," forming "harm."

**Examples**:  
- 他(tā)被(bèi)人(rén)陷害(xiàn hài)了(le)。 (Tā bèi rén xiàn hài le.) - He was framed by someone.  
- 我(wǒ)绝不(jué bù)会(huì)陷害(xiàn hài)你(nǐ)。 (Wǒ jué bù huì xiàn hài nǐ.) - I would never frame you.  
- 那(nà)个(gè)计(jì)划(huà)是(shì)用来(yòng lái)陷害(xiàn hài)他的(tā de)。 (Nà gè jì huà shì yòng lái xiàn hài tā de.) - That plan was designed to frame him.

**Usage Notes**:  
Usually refers to intentionally making someone appear guilty or causing them harm via trickery. Often used in passive form with "被" (bèi).

**Memory Aids**:  
"陷" (xiàn) is a "trap" in the "land" (阝). "害" (hài) is "harm" hiding under a "roof" (宀). So, "陷害" (xiàn hài) is "harming someone by trapping them beneath the surface."
