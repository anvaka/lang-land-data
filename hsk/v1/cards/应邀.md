# **应邀 (yìngyāo) - To accept an invitation**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **应 (yìng)**: "To answer/respond." Left: "广 (guǎng)" radical (shelter/building), right: "丶 (zhǔ)" (dot) and "卯 (mǎo)" (one of the earthly branches, here phonetic).  
- **邀 (yāo)**: "To invite." Left: "辶 (chuò)" radical (walk/movement, bottom), right: "敫 (jiǎo)" (phonetic, means brilliant/luminous).

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 应邀 (yìngyāo) 参加 (cānjiā) 了 (le) 会议 (huìyì)。 (Tā yìngyāo cānjiā le huìyì.) - He accepted the invitation to attend the meeting.  
- 她 (tā) 没有 (méiyǒu) 应邀 (yìngyāo) 去 (qù) 晚会 (wǎnhuì)。 (Tā méiyǒu yìngyāo qù wǎnhuì.) - She did not accept the invitation to go to the party.  
- 我们 (wǒmen) 应邀 (yìngyāo) 访问 (fǎngwèn) 了 (le) 他们 (tāmen) 的 (de) 学校 (xuéxiào)。 (Wǒmen yìngyāo fǎngwèn le tāmen de xuéxiào.) - We accepted the invitation to visit their school.

**Usage Notes**:  
"应邀 (yìngyāo)" is typically a formal expression, often used in written or official contexts. Usually takes the form 应邀 (yìngyāo) + verb (e.g., 参加 (cānjiā), 出席 (chūxí)).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think "respond (应 (yìng)) to invitation (邀 (yāo))" = "accept an invitation." Picture yourself walking (辶 (chuò)) toward an open door (广 (guǎng)) after getting an invite!
