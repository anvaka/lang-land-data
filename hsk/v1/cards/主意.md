# **主意 (zhǔ yì) - idea, plan, opinion**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 主 (zhǔ): "master," "main," or "host." The radical on top (丶, zhǔ) means "dot," above the component below (王, wáng, "king"). Suggests "person in control."  
- 意 (yì): "meaning," "thought." Top: 音 (yīn, "sound"); bottom: 心 (xīn, "heart")-together suggesting thoughts from the heart.

**Examples**:  
- 你有什么主意？(nǐ yǒu shénme zhǔ yì?) - Do you have any ideas?  
- 这个主意不错。(zhè ge zhǔ yì bú cuò.) - This is a good idea.  
- 我改变了主意。(wǒ gǎi biàn le zhǔ yì.) - I changed my mind.

**Usage Notes**:  
主意 (zhǔ yì) refers to personal proposals or opinions, often used when discussing plans or suggestions. Common with verbs like 有 (yǒu, "have"), 想 (xiǎng, "think"), or 改变 (gǎi biàn, "change").

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of a "main" (主, zhǔ) thought from the "heart" (意, yì). The master (主, zhǔ) comes up with new ideas (意, yì)!
