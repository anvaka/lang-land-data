# **搅拌 (jiǎo bàn) - to stir/mix**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 搅 (jiǎo): "to stir"
  - 操 (hand radical, 扌, on the left) = related to hand actions.
  - 肴 (right side, refers to food/dish) gives sound/meaning.  
- 拌 (bàn): "to mix"
  - 扌 (hand radical, left) = action by hand.
  - 半 (bàn, right) means "half" (suggesting mixture or part).

**Examples**:

- 用勺子搅拌咖啡。(Yòng sháo zi jiǎo bàn kā fēi.) - Stir the coffee with a spoon.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 搅拌 (jiǎo bàn) is a verb for physically mixing or stirring (not for digital or abstract mixing).  
- Often used in cooking or chemistry contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Both characters use 扌 (hand) → imagine using your hand to stir or mix things.  
- 拌 (bàn) has 半 (bàn, half) inside: when you "half-mix," you haven't fully blended everything!
