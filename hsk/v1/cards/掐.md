# **掐 (qiā) - to pinch; to nip**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 掐 (qiā): Left: 扌 (shǒu, "hand" radical)-indicates action performed by hand.
  Right: 合 (hé)-means "to combine, to close"; here suggests pressing together.

**Examples**:  
- 妈妈掐(qiā)了一下我的脸。(Māma qiā le yíxià wǒ de liǎn.) - Mom pinched my cheek.  
- 他用手掐(qiā)住了花茎。(Tā yòng shǒu qiā zhù le huā jīng.) - He pinched the flower stem with his hand.  
- 你别掐(qiā)我！(Nǐ bié qiā wǒ!) - Don’t pinch me!

**Usage Notes**:  
掐(qiā) is usually a verb describing pinching with finger tips; can be physical or figurative ("to estimate" as in 掐(qiā)算(suàn), "roughly calculate").

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine using your hand (扌 shǒu) to bring things together (合 hé)-like pinching to combine or hold tightly.
