# **会晤 (huì wù) - Meeting, to meet (formally)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **会 (huì)**: “to meet, can”
  - Radical: 亻(person, left) + 云(cloud, top) = assembly, gathering.  
- **晤 (wù)**: “to meet face-to-face”
  - Left: 日 (rì, sun), right: 吾 (wú, I/me) = seeing someone in person, "sun" suggesting direct, open view.

**Examples**:  
- 两国领导人将会晤。(Liǎng guó lǐngdǎo rén jiāng huìwù.) - The leaders of the two countries will meet.  
- 他们昨天在上海会晤。(Tāmen zuótiān zài Shànghǎi huìwù.) - They met in Shanghai yesterday.  
- 总统计划与首相会晤。(Zǒngtǒng jìhuà yǔ shǒuxiàng huìwù.) - The president plans to meet with the prime minister.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 会晤 (huìwù) is formal, for high-level/official meetings-rarely used in daily conversations. For casual meetings, use 见面 (jiànmiàn).

**Memory Aids**:  
- 会 (huì): Imagine people coming together under a roof (cloud).  
- 晤 (wù): The "sun" (日, rì) shines directly when you meet someone face-to-face-clear, open meeting.
