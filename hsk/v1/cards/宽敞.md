# **宽敞 (kuānchǎng) - Spacious**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 宽 (kuān): "Wide, broad." Left: 宀 (mián, "roof") at the top, gives a sense of covering. Right: 见 (jiàn, "see") underneath, together suggests a lot of visible space under a roof.  
- 敞 (chǎng): "Open, spacious." Left: 攵 (pū, "action" radical) at the right, related to movement. Right: 尚 (shàng, "esteem") on the left, combined to denote opening up.

**Examples**:  
- 这个房间很宽敞。(Zhège fángjiān hěn kuānchǎng.) - This room is very spacious.  
- 图书馆又宽敞又明亮。(Túshūguǎn yòu kuānchǎng yòu míngliàng.) - The library is both spacious and bright.  
- 我喜欢宽敞的环境。(Wǒ xǐhuān kuānchǎng de huánjìng.) - I like spacious environments.

**Usage Notes**:  
宽敞 (kuānchǎng) is used as an adjective, often to describe rooms, buildings, or indoor spaces. Usually paired with nouns like 房间 (fángjiān - room), 客厅 (kètīng - living room), 环境 (huánjìng - environment).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 宽 (kuān)’s roof covering a wide area, and 敞 (chǎng) as "open" (moving things away) to make more space. Wide roof + open movement = spacious!
