# **煎 (jiān) - to pan-fry; to fry in shallow oil**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 煎 (jiān):
  - Radical: 火 (huǒ) "fire", at the left (sometimes bottom, as 灬(huǒ)), representing heat or cooking.
  - Right: 戋 (jiān), meaning "narrow/limited", suggesting a small amount (of oil or water).

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢煎(jiān)蛋。(Wǒ xǐhuān jiān dàn.) - I like fried eggs.

- 她会煎(jiān)好牛排。(Tā huì jiān hǎo niúpái.) - She can pan-fry steak well.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 煎(jiān) is used for cooking with little oil, unlike 炸(zhá) (deep-fry).  
- Often used with foods: 煎(jiān)蛋(egg), 煎(jiān)饺(dumpling), 煎(jiān)牛排(steak).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think: use "fire" (火(huǒ)) to cook with just a "narrow" (戋(jiān)) bit of oil-煎(jiān) means to pan-fry!
