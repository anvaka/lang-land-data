# **从前 (cóngqián) - Once upon a time; in the past**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **从 (cóng)**: Left side is "人 (rén, person)" radical, depicting two people (one behind the other) to suggest "following", "from", or "since".  
- **前 (qián)**: Top is "刂 (dāo, knife)" on the right, left is "月 (yuè, moon/flesh)", and bottom is "舟 (zhōu, boat)"-together indicating "front", "before", or "ahead".

**Examples**:  
- **从前有一个小村庄。** (Cóngqián yǒu yī gè xiǎo cūnzhuāng.) - Once upon a time, there was a small village.  
- **从前我们常常见面。** (Cóngqián wǒmen chángcháng jiànmiàn.) - We used to meet often in the past.  
- **他讲了一个从前的故事。** (Tā jiǎngle yī gè cóngqián de gùshì.) - He told a story from the past.

**Usage Notes**:  
**从前 (cóngqián)** commonly starts folk tales or stories, much like "once upon a time" in English. It can also refer generally to "before" or "in former times".

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: **从 (cóng, following)** the **前 (qián, before/front)**-to follow what came before. Imagine people in a line facing the past, about to tell a story.
