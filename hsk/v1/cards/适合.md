# **适合 (shìhé) - suitable; fit**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **适 (shì)**: left is ⻌(chuò) "walk/movement" radical (left), right is 𠬝(shì) "ally/approach" (right). Together: "to fit, to suit".  
- **合 (hé)**: "lid" (top), "mouth" (middle), and "one" (bottom); means "to join, to combine".

**Examples**:  
- 这件衣服很适合你。(Zhè jiàn yīfu hěn shìhé nǐ.) - This piece of clothing suits you well.  
- 这个工作适合我吗？(Zhège gōngzuò shìhé wǒ ma?) - Is this job suitable for me?  
- 我们的兴趣不太适合。(Wǒmen de xìngqù bù tài shìhé.) - Our interests are not very compatible.

**Usage Notes**:  
适合 (shìhé) is typically used for "A fits/suits B," often followed by an object/person (e.g., 适合你 (shìhé nǐ)). Can be used as verb or adjective.

**Memory Aids**:  
适 (shì) moves (⻌chuò) to match; 合 (hé) combines-so, "moving to combine" equals "suitable/fit".
