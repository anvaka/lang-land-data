# **手法 (shǒu fǎ) - Technique; method; trick**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **手 (shǒu)**: "Hand." Radical: 扌(left), represents hand actions; right is 千(qiān,"thousand"), but here mainly phonetic.  
- **法 (fǎ)**: "Law; method." Radical: 氵(left, "water") + 去(qù, right, "go/leave"). Suggests flowing principles.

**Examples**:  
- 他的绘画手法很独特。(Tā de huìhuà shǒufǎ hěn dútè.) - His painting technique is unique.  
- 她用巧妙的手法解决了问题。(Tā yòng qiǎomiào de shǒufǎ jiějuéle wèntí.) - She solved the problem with clever methods.  
- 这种销售手法不太正当。(Zhè zhǒng xiāoshòu shǒufǎ bù tài zhèngdàng.) - This kind of sales tactic is not very proper.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **手法 (shǒu fǎ)** refers to techniques in art, writing, or skills, and sometimes negative tricks.  
- Common with verbs: 使用手法 (shǐyòng shǒufǎ, "use a technique") or 巧妙手法 (qiǎomiào shǒufǎ, "ingenious method").

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine your "手 (shǒu, hand)" applying a smart "法 (fǎ, method)" to solve a problem-hands using methods.  
- "手 (shǒu, hand)" + "法 (fǎ, method)" = "handy method" (technique or trick).
