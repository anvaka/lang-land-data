# **严格 (yán gé) - Strict / Rigorous**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **严 (yán)**: Top: "亠" (tóu) - lid; Bottom: "口" (kǒu) - mouth. Means "strict," "severe."  
- **格 (gé)**: Left: "木" (mù) - wood; Right: "各" (gè) - each. Means "standard," "pattern," "frame."

**Examples**:  
- 老师 (lǎo shī) 对 (duì) 学生 (xué shēng) 很 (hěn) 严格 (yán gé)。 (The teacher is very strict with students.)  
- 严格 (yán gé) 按照 (àn zhào) 规定 (guī dìng) 执行 (zhí xíng)。 (Strictly follow the rules.)  
- 他的 (tā de) 父母 (fù mǔ) 非常 (fēi cháng) 严格 (yán gé)。 (His parents are very strict.)

**Usage Notes**:  
- 严格 (yán gé) is usually used before objects like "要求 (yāo qiú)" (requirements), "管理 (guǎn lǐ)" (management), or as a predicate (to describe someone/something being strict). Can be used adverbially: "严格地 (yán gé de)."

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think of "严 (yán)" as a mouth (口 kǒu) under a "lid" being shut-strict control. "格 (gé)" is like a tree (木 mù) set within boundaries or frames (各 gè)-following fixed standards.
