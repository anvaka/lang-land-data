# **当然 (dāngrán) - of course; certainly**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **当** (dāng): means "should," "to be," or "appropriate." It consists of "⺧" (niú, cow radical) at the top and "小" (xiǎo, small) at the bottom.  
- **然** (rán): means "so," "thus," or "correct." On the left is "灬" (huǒ, fire radical) at the bottom, and on the right is "月" (yuè, moon/flesh) on top of "犬" (quǎn, dog).

**Examples**:  
- 你( nǐ ) 当然( dāngrán ) 可以( kěyǐ )！(nǐ dāngrán kěyǐ!) - Of course you can!  
- 当然( dāngrán ) 我( wǒ ) 喜欢( xǐhuān )。(dāngrán wǒ xǐhuān.) - Of course I like it.  
- 这( zhè ) 是( shì ) 当然( dāngrán ) 的( de )。(zhè shì dāngrán de.) - This is natural/of course.

**Usage Notes**:  
- Used to affirm, agree, or emphasize certainty.  
- Often at the beginning of a sentence.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think: "当" (dāng, to be proper) + "然" (rán, so) = "proper and so" = of course.  
- "Definitely (当, dāng) so (然, rán)!" - so it must be true!
