# **药 (yào) - medicine**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 药 (yào):
  - Radical: 艹 (cǎo) - grass, on the top, often relates to plants
  - Component: 乐 (lè) inside/below, meaning "joy" but here as a phonetic
  - Origin: Many medicines come from plants, so "grass" radical fits.

**Examples**:  
- 我需要吃药。(Wǒ xūyào chī yào.) - I need to take medicine.  
- 这是什么药？(Zhè shì shénme yào?) - What kind of medicine is this?  
- 医生开了药给我。(Yīshēng kāi le yào gěi wǒ.) - The doctor prescribed medicine for me.

**Usage Notes**:  
药 (yào) can refer to any medicine or drug. Used as a noun, often paired with verbs like 吃 (chī, take orally), 喝 (hē, drink), or 开 (kāi, prescribe).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: 药 (yào) has the "grass" (艹, cǎo) radical on top → many medicines are made from plants. "Joy" (乐, lè) below, because medicine makes you feel better.
