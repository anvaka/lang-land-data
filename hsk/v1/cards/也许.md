# **也许 (yěxǔ) - maybe; perhaps**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 也 (yě): means "also/as well"; top part is a horizontal stroke, bottom part resembles a backwards "L".  
- 许 (xǔ): means "to allow; perhaps"; left side is 讠(yán), the "speech" radical, right side is 午(wǔ), suggesting sound.

**Examples**:  
- 也许(yěxǔ)明天(míngtiān)会(huì)下雨(xiàyǔ)。 (yěxǔ míngtiān huì xiàyǔ.) - Maybe it will rain tomorrow.  
- 他(tā)也许(yěxǔ)已经(yǐjīng)走了(zǒu le)。 (tā yěxǔ yǐjīng zǒu le.) - He may have already left.  
- 你(nǐ)也许(yěxǔ)喜欢(xǐhuān)这个(zhège)。 (nǐ yěxǔ xǐhuān zhège.) - You might like this.

**Usage Notes**:  
也许(yěxǔ) usually appears before the subject or verb, expressing possibility or uncertainty.

**Memory Aids**:  
也(yě): "also" - as in "maybe *also*".  
许(xǔ): contains 讠(yán/"speech") - maybe it's just someone saying/permitting it, not certain.
