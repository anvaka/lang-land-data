# **阐述 (chǎn shù) - To elaborate; to expound**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **阐 (chǎn):** Left = 门 (mén, "door" radical), right = 单 (dān, "single/simple"). Suggests "opening the door to explanation."  
- **述 (shù):** Left = 辶 (chuò, "walk" radical), right = 术 (shù, "technique/art"). Implies "walking through an explanation or statement."

**Examples**:  
- 请 (qǐng) 你 (nǐ) 阐述 (chǎn shù) 你的 (nǐ de) 观点 (guān diǎn)。 (Please elaborate on your viewpoint.)  
- 老师 (lǎo shī) 详细 (xiáng xì) 阐述 (chǎn shù) 了 (le) 这个 (zhè ge) 概念 (gài niàn)。 (The teacher elaborated on this concept in detail.)  
- 论文 (lùn wén) 要 (yào) 清楚 (qīng chǔ) 阐述 (chǎn shù) 论点 (lùn diǎn)。 (The paper must clearly expound its argument.)

**Usage Notes**:  
- 阐述 (chǎn shù) is formal and often used in essays, academic, or professional settings.  
- Often followed by 对 (duì, "regarding") + something.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine opening a "door" (门, mén) to explain (单, dān) your view and then "walking" (辶, chuò) through the "art" (术, shù) of elaboration.  
- 阐述 (chǎn shù) = "open up and walk through your explanation."
