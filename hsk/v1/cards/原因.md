# **原因 (yuán yīn) - Cause; reason**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **原** (yuán): "origin," "source."
  - Radical: 厂 (hǎn) "cliff" on the left, and the top-right is 白 (bái) "white." The bottom is 小 (xiǎo) "small."  
- **因** (yīn): "cause," "reason."
  - Radical: 囗 (wéi) "enclosure" on the outside, and 大 (dà) "big" inside.

**Examples**:  
- 这是主要的原因。(Zhè shì zhǔyào de yuán yīn.) - This is the main reason.  
- 我想知道原因。(Wǒ xiǎng zhīdào yuán yīn.) - I want to know the reason.  
- 没有人告诉我原因。(Méiyǒu rén gàosu wǒ yuán yīn.) - No one told me the cause.

**Usage Notes**:  
原因 (yuán yīn) is typically followed by a clause or phrase explaining what the reason is. Used in both written and spoken contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
"原" (yuán) is the "origin," the starting point, and "因" (yīn) encloses the "big" (大 (dà)) reason within a box-together they form the "cause."
