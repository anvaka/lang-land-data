# **提 (tí) - to carry, to lift, to raise, to mention**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 提 (tí): The left side is 扌(shǒu), the "hand" radical, showing the action is done by hand. The right side is 是(shì), which by itself means "is/are" but here adds sound.

**Examples**:  
- 请你提一下箱子。(Qǐng nǐ tí yíxià xiāngzi.) - Please lift the suitcase.  
- 他提了一个问题。(Tā tí le yí gè wèntí.) - He raised a question.  
- 别忘了提意见。(Bié wàngle tí yìjiàn.) - Don’t forget to give suggestions.

**Usage Notes**:  
提 (tí) is often followed by objects representing what’s lifted or mentioned, literal (objects) or abstract (ideas, questions).

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine your 手(shǒu) (hand) 提 (tí) (lifting) something up to 提 (tí) (mention) it!
