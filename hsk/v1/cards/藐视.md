# **藐视 (miǎo shì) - To despise / look down on**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **藐 (miǎo)**: Left - 艹 (cǎo, "grass" radical), Top-right - 少 (shǎo, "few/little"), Bottom-right - 目 (mù, "eye"). Originally means "small/faint in the distance."  
- **视 (shì)**: Left - 视 (shì, "see"), Right - 见 (jiàn, "see"). Means "to look" or "to regard."

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 藐视 (miǎo shì) 规则 (guī zé)。 (Tā miǎo shì guī zé.) - He despises the rules.  
- 不要 (bù yào) 藐视 (miǎo shì) 别人 (bié rén)。 (Bù yào miǎo shì bié rén.) - Don’t look down on others.

**Usage Notes**:  
藐视 (miǎo shì) is formal and used in both written and spoken Chinese. Objects are often abstract (rules, authority, etc.) or people.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: An eye (目, mù) above grass (艹, cǎo) barely notices the small things below-it "looks down" (视, shì) contemptuously.
