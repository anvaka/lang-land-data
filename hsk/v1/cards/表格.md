# **表格 (biǎo gé) - Table; Form**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **表 (biǎo)**: Outer surface, to show, a list. Top: "亠 (tóu)" (lid), middle: "衣 (yī)" without the left dot, indicating clothing as something seen on the outside.  
- **格 (gé)**: Pattern, frame, standard. Left: "木 (mù)" (tree/wood), right: "各 (gè)" meaning "each," suggests compartments or divisions like a grid.

**Examples**:  
- 请填写表格。(Qǐng tiánxiě biǎogé.) - Please fill out the form.  
- 这个表格很复杂。(Zhège biǎogé hěn fùzá.) - This table/form is complicated.  
- 我需要一份新的表格。(Wǒ xūyào yí fèn xīn de biǎogé.) - I need a new form.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **表格 (biǎo gé)** refers to structured data or forms with columns and rows (not a physical table, which is **桌子 (zhuōzi)**).  
- Common in school, business, and computer contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
- **表 (biǎo)** looks like something spread out to display.  
- **格 (gé)**’s "木 (mù)" can remind you of a wooden frame, "各 (gè)" for compartments-like a form’s boxes.
