# **狭隘 (xiá'ài) - Narrow; narrow-minded**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 狭 (xiá): Narrow. Left: “犭”(quǎn) - animal radical; right: “夹”(jiā) - to press from both sides. Suggests something restricted.  
- 隘 (ài): Narrow, confined. Left: “阝”(fù) - mound radical; right: “益”(yì) without the “皿”(mǐn) on the bottom. Means blocking or being obstructed.

**Examples**:  
- 他的视野很狭隘。(Tā de shìyě hěn xiá'ài.) - His perspective is very narrow-minded.  
- 不要有狭隘的想法。(Bù yào yǒu xiá'ài de xiǎngfǎ.) - Don’t have narrow ideas.  
- 这里的道路很狭隘。(Zhèlǐ de dàolù hěn xiá'ài.) - The roads here are very narrow.

**Usage Notes**:  
狭隘(xiá'ài) describes both physical narrowness (roads, spaces) and figurative narrowness (mindset, perspective). Often used negatively to criticize someone.

**Memory Aids**:  
狭(xiá) with the animal radical, think “animals squeezed in.” 隘(ài) with the mound, picture a blocked mountain pass-both restrict movement or thought.
