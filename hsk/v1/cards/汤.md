# **汤 (tāng) - soup**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 汤 (tāng):
  - Radical: 氵(left - “water” component)
  - Right: 昜 (yáng) - phonetic; means "rising sun," but here helps with pronunciation.
  - Whole means "soup" or "broth," related to liquids.

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢喝汤。(Wǒ xǐhuān hē tāng.) - I like to drink soup.  
- 这碗汤很热。(Zhè wǎn tāng hěn rè.) - This bowl of soup is hot.  
- 妈妈在煮汤。(Māma zài zhǔ tāng.) - Mom is cooking soup.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 汤 (tāng) is mainly used for clear or broth-based soups, not thick stews.  
- Common in dishes: 鸡汤 (jī tāng) - chicken soup; 牛肉汤 (niú ròu tāng) - beef soup.

**Memory Aids**:  
- The water radical 氵(shuǐ) on the left reminds you 汤 (tāng) is a liquid.  
- Think: "A rising sun (昜 yáng) brings a warm bowl of 汤 (tāng) at breakfast."
