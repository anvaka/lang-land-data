# **抹杀 (mǒshā) - Wipe out; obliterate; erase (often fig., to deny or negate completely)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 抹 (mǒ): Left: 扌(shǒu, "hand" radical indicating action with the hand); Right: 末(mò, "end"); base meaning: to wipe or spread.  
- 杀 (shā): Top: 杀(shā, "kill") has a complex composition; traditionally, right is 木(mù, "wood"), left is representing a weapon or action. Modern simplified: 巳(sì, "silk"), below 小(xiǎo, "small"). Means to kill or destroy.

**Examples**:  
- 没有人能抹杀(mǒshā)他的贡献。(Méi yǒu rén néng mǒshā tā de gòngxiàn.) - No one can erase his contributions.  
- 这种经历无法被抹杀(mǒshā)。(Zhè zhǒng jīnglì wúfǎ bèi mǒshā.) - This experience cannot be wiped out.  
- 他们试图抹杀(mǒshā)真相。(Tāmen shìtú mǒshā zhēnxiàng.) - They tried to erase the truth.

**Usage Notes**:  
抹杀(mǒshā) is often used figuratively-to deny, erase, or reject someone's effort, truth, or history. It’s seldom about physical wiping; more about negating existence or value.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine "wiping" (抹(mǒ)) something away so thoroughly it’s "killed off" (杀(shā))-to completely remove from recognition.
