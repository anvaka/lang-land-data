# **完毕 (wán bì) - To finish; to complete**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **完 (wán)**: Top = 宀 (mián, "roof"); bottom = 元 (yuán, "origin"). Together, means "complete" or "finished", like a roof over a house when construction is finished.  
- **毕 (bì)**: Top = 比 (bǐ, "compare"); bottom = 十 (shí, "ten"). Implies "to finish" or "to end," as in bringing something to its conclusion.

**Examples**:  
- 工作完毕。(gōng zuò wán bì) - The work is finished.  
- 比赛完毕后，我们去吃饭。(bǐ sài wán bì hòu, wǒ men qù chī fàn) - After the competition is over, we’ll go eat.  
- 请报告任务完毕。(qǐng bào gào rèn wù wán bì) - Please report when the task is completed.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 完毕 (wán bì) is formal and often used for events, tasks, or announcements. For daily talk, 完了 (wán le) is more common.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 完 (wán) = "roof finished, house complete"; 毕 (bì) = "all compared (比) done (十 = 10 = a full set), so finished."  
- 完毕 (wán bì) = "Completely finished!"
