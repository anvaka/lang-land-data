# **照耀 (zhào yào) - To shine; to illuminate**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **照** (zhào): left side "昭" (zhāo, bright), right side "灬" (huǒ, fire) at the bottom; overall suggests light/fire illuminating.  
- **耀** (yào): left "羽" (yǔ, feather) on top of "缶" (fǒu, clay jar), with "光" (guāng, light) at the bottom right; conveys shining or emitting light.

**Examples**:  
- 阳光照耀着大地。(Yángguāng zhàoyào zhe dàdì.) - The sunlight shines upon the earth.  
- 星星在夜空中照耀。(Xīngxing zài yèkōng zhōng zhàoyào.) - The stars shine in the night sky.  
- 灯光照耀着整个房间。(Dēngguāng zhàoyào zhe zhěnggè fángjiān.) - The light illuminates the whole room.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **照耀** (zhào yào) is often used for bright, widespread light (sun, stars, lamps), both literally and metaphorically.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a feather (**羽** yǔ) glowing (**光** guāng) brightly under fire (**灬** huǒ), helping the sun shine everywhere-just like **照耀** (zhào yào).
