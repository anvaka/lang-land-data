# **充实 (chōng shí) - Enrich; substantial; fulfilling**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **充 (chōng)**: "to fill, to satisfy". Left: "亻" (rén, person radical) adding context of being filled or related to people; rest of the character illustrates the act of filling up from the top.  
- **实 (shí)**: "real, solid, true". Top: "宀" (mián, roof radical) suggests a house; inside: "头" (tóu, head) meaning inside the roof-something substantial; bottom: stroke indicating fullness inside.

**Examples**:  
- 他的生活很充实。(Tā de shēnghuó hěn chōngshí.) - His life is very fulfilling.  
- 这本书内容非常充实。(Zhè běn shū nèiróng fēicháng chōngshí.) - The content of this book is very substantial.  
- 我想充实自己。(Wǒ xiǎng chōngshí zìjǐ.) - I want to enrich myself.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **充实 (chōng shí)** is typically used for abstract ideas (life, knowledge, content), not physical objects.  
- Can function as an adjective (生活充实 chōngshí) or verb (充实自己 chōngshí zìjǐ).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine pouring content under a roof (实 shí), filling it up (充 chōng), making it "充实 (chōngshí)"-full and complete inside.
