# **自觉 (zì jué) - self-aware; conscious**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 自 (zì): "self". Top: “目” (mù, eye) component, suggests original meaning "nose" (self).  
- 觉 (jué): "to sense; aware". Left: “见” (jiàn, to see); right: “⺌” (small), combining the ideas of seeing and perceiving.

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 很自觉 (hěn zì jué) - He is very self-disciplined.  
- 请 (qǐng) 自觉 (zì jué) 排队 (pái duì) - Please queue up consciously.  
- 她 (tā) 没有 (méi yǒu) 自觉 (zì jué) 地 (de) 打扫 (dǎ sǎo) 房间 (fáng jiān) - She didn't clean the room on her own initiative.

**Usage Notes**:  
自觉 (zì jué) is often used to describe someone acting with self-discipline or initiative, without being told.

**Memory Aids**:  
自 (zì, self): Picture your "eye" (目 mù) watching yourself (self).  
觉 (jué, aware): Associate "seeing" (见 jiàn) with "awareness."  
Together: "Self" + "aware" = conscious of oneself.
