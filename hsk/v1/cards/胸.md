**Usage Notes**:  
- **胸**(xiōng) most often refers to the chest (part of the body).  
- In **胸怀**(xiōnghuái), it means "mind, heart, aspirations."

**Memory Aids**:  
- The "meat" radical on the left shows it's about a body part, and the right side hints at its pronunciation (**xiōng**).  
- Think: Your "chest" (**胸** [xiōng]) is where your heart and emotions are, so it's both physical and emotional!
