# **眼光 (yǎn guāng) - Vision; insight; foresight**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **眼** (yǎn): eye. Left side “目” (mù, eye radical) indicates the meaning; right side “艮” (gěn) adds sound.  
- **光** (guāng): light. Top “⺌” (small dots, representing rays) and bottom “儿” (ér, child radical, here a variant) together convey “rays of light.”

**Examples**:  
- 他的**眼光**(yǎn guāng)很独到。(Tā de yǎn guāng hěn dú dào.) - His insight is unique.  
- 她用挑剔的**眼光**(yǎn guāng)看人。(Tā yòng tiāo tì de yǎn guāng kàn rén.) - She looks at people with a critical eye.  
- 你要有长远的**眼光**(yǎn guāng)。(Nǐ yào yǒu cháng yuǎn de yǎn guāng.) - You need to have long-term vision.

**Usage Notes**:  
**眼光**(yǎn guāng) can refer to literal eyesight, but more commonly means one’s judgment, taste, or ability to see opportunities. Often used to praise or remark on someone’s perspective.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: **眼**(yǎn, eye) + **光**(guāng, light) = “eyes that emit light” → someone who sees clearly, both literally and figuratively.
