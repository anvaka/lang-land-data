# **何必 (hé bì) - Why bother; there’s no need**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **何 (hé)**: meaning “why” or “what”. Left: “亻” (rén, person) radical. Right: “可” (kě, can/possible).  
- **必 (bì)**: meaning “must”, “necessarily”. Top: “八” (bā), split/divide; bottom: “心” (xīn, heart).

**Examples**:  
- 你何必 (nǐ hé bì) 生气？(shēng qì) - Why bother getting angry?  
- 他何必 (tā hé bì) 这么做？(zhè me zuò) - Why does he have to do this?  
- 我何必 (wǒ hé bì) 担心？(dān xīn) - Why should I worry?

**Usage Notes**:  
何必 (hé bì) is often used to express that something is unnecessary or not worth the effort. It’s rhetorical; answers are not expected. Usually followed by a verb or verb phrase.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine a person (亻, rén) asking “what’s the point” with their heart (心, xīn) split (八, bā) in two - must you really do this? Why bother?
