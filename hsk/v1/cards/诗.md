# **诗 (shī) - poem; poetry**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 诗 (shī): Left side is 讠(yán, "speech" radical) suggesting relation to language; right side is 寺(sì, "temple"), but here acts phonetically.

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢读诗。(Wǒ xǐhuān dú shī.) - I like reading poetry.  
- 她写了一首诗。(Tā xiě le yī shǒu shī.) - She wrote a poem.  
- 这首诗很美。(Zhè shǒu shī hěn měi.) - This poem is very beautiful.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 诗(shī) is a noun.  
- Often combined as 诗歌(shī gē, poetry), or with 诗人(shī rén, poet).  
- Used for both classical and modern poetry.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 讠(yán, "speech") + 寺(sì, "temple"): Temple speech can be poetic!  
- "Shī" sounds like "she"-think "she wrote a poem."
