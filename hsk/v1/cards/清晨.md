# **清晨 (qīngchén) - early morning**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **清 (qīng)**: "clear, pure." Left: "氵" (three water dots, left) = water; Right: "青" (qīng, top: a plant sprout, bottom: ground) = blue/green, suggesting freshness.  
- **晨 (chén)**: "morning." Top: "辰" (chén, stylized morning icon: sun rising above, fields below), Bottom: single horizontal stroke.

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢清晨的空气。(Wǒ xǐhuan qīngchén de kōngqì.) - I like the air in the early morning.  
- 清晨，鸟儿开始歌唱。(Qīngchén, niǎor kāishǐ gēchàng.) - In the early morning, birds start to sing.  
- 清晨六点天刚亮。(Qīngchén liù diǎn tiān gāng liàng.) - At six in the early morning, the sky just brightens.

**Usage Notes**:  
**清晨 (qīngchén)** refers to the period just after dawn, often used in written or poetic contexts, less in casual speech than **早上 (zǎoshang, morning)**.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of **清 (qīng)** as "pure/clear" and **晨 (chén)** as "morning"-so the "purest" part of the morning: dawn.
