# **包 (bāo) - bag; to wrap**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **包** (bāo): On top is "勹" (bāo) meaning "wrap/enclose"; inside at the bottom is "巳" (sì), which looks like something being wrapped up.

**Examples**:  
- 请把包(bāo)放在桌子上。(Qǐng bǎ bāo fàng zài zhuōzi shàng.) - Please put the bag on the table.  
- 他想包(bāo)一个饺子。(Tā xiǎng bāo yīgè jiǎozi.) - He wants to wrap a dumpling.  
- 这是我的书包(bāo)。(Zhè shì wǒ de shūbāo.) - This is my backpack.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **包** (bāo) can be a noun ("bag") or verb ("to wrap"). Frequently used in compound words (e.g., 书包(shūbāo) - school bag, 包子(bāozi) - steamed bun).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine the "勹"(bāo) radical as two arms wrapping around the "巳"(sì) component (something inside), just like wrapping or covering something in a bag.
