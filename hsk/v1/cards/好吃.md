# **好吃 (hǎo chī) - Tasty / Delicious**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 好 (hǎo): Good. Left: 女 (nǚ, "woman"), right: 子 (zǐ, "child"); together historically symbolizes harmony/goodness.  
- 吃 (chī): To eat. Left: 口 (kǒu, "mouth"), right: 契 (qì, phonetically for the sound).

**Examples**:  
- 这个蛋糕很好吃。(Zhè ge dàngāo hěn hǎo chī.) - This cake is delicious.  
- 你觉得这个菜好吃吗？(Nǐ juéde zhè ge cài hǎo chī ma?) - Do you think this dish is tasty?  
- 面包不太好吃。(Miànbāo bú tài hǎo chī.) - The bread isn’t very tasty.

**Usage Notes**:  
好吃 (hǎo chī) describes food that tastes good. Only use it for things you can eat. For drinks, use 好喝 (hǎo hē).

**Memory Aids**:  
好 (hǎo) is "good," 吃 (chī) is "to eat"-so if something is “good to eat”, it must be delicious!
