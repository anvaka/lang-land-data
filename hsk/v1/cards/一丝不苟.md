# **一丝不苟 (yī sī bù gǒu) - Meticulous; not one thread loose**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 一 (yī): "One", a single horizontal stroke, indicating singularity.  
- 丝 (sī): "Thread", silk radical (纟, sī) on the left; right is “小” (xiǎo) on the bottom, meaning "small"-small lines of silk = thread.  
- 不 (bù): "Not", a horizontal line (top), with a diagonal "tick" below, a common negation particle.  
- 苟 (gǒu): "Careless", “艹” (cǎo, "grass") on the top, “句” (jù, "sentence" or "phrase") below. Originally meant "carelessly picking grass", now "careless"; negated here.

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 做事 (zuò shì) 一丝不苟 (yī sī bù gǒu)。- He is meticulous in his work.  
- 她 (tā) 对 (duì) 细节 (xì jié) 一丝不苟 (yī sī bù gǒu)。- She pays attention to every detail.  
- 一丝不苟 (yī sī bù gǒu) 的 (de) 态度 (tài dù) 让人 (ràng rén) 敬佩 (jìng pèi)。- Such meticulousness is admirable.

**Usage Notes**:  
Often describes people’s attitude/work style. Usually not for trivial tasks, but for craft, study, or responsibilities. Adjective/idiom; often follows subject or colocates with verbs.

**Memory Aids**:  
Picture “not (不, bù) even a single (一, yī) thread (丝, sī) is handled carelessly (苟, gǒu);” perfection without missing any detail.
