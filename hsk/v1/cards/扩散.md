# **扩散 (kuòsàn) - Spread, diffusion**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **扩** (kuò): Means "expand, enlarge." The left side is the "扌" (shǒu) hand radical (left), indicating action; right side is "广" (guǎng), suggesting "broad" or "wide."  
- **散** (sàn): Means "scatter, disperse." Top is "⺮" (zhú) bamboo radical (top); bottom is "攵" (pū) tap/strike (right), with "夗" (yuàn) (left) meaning "to desire/leisure," hinting at something spreading out loosely.

**Examples**:  
- 谣言正在扩散。(Yáoyán zhèngzài kuòsàn.) - The rumor is spreading.  
- 请防止病毒扩散。(Qǐng fángzhǐ bìngdú kuòsàn.) - Please prevent the virus from spreading.  
- 信息迅速扩散开来。(Xìnxī xùnsù kuòsàn kāi lái.) - Information spreads out quickly.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **扩散** (kuòsàn) is often used for physical or abstract spreading: gases, information, influences, or diseases.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a hand (**扌** (shǒu)) is pushing something to make it wider (**扩** (kuò)), and then it scatters (**散** (sàn)) everywhere like bamboo leaves blowing in the wind.
