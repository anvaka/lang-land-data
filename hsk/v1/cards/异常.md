# **异常 (yìcháng) - Abnormal; unusual**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **异** (yì): *Left-right*: Left is 田 (tián, "field"), right is 共 (gòng, as a phonetic component). Means "different, unusual."  
- **常** (cháng): *Top-mid-bottom*: Top is 宀 (mián, "roof"), middle is 尚 (shàng, "esteemed," here as a phonetic), bottom is 一 (yī, "one"). Means "common, usual."

**Examples**:  
- 温度异常高。(Wēndù yìcháng gāo.) - The temperature is abnormally high.  
- 他今天行为异常。(Tā jīntiān xíngwéi yìcháng.) - His behavior is unusual today.  
- 系统出现异常。(Xìtǒng chūxiàn yìcháng.) - The system has an abnormality.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **异常** (yìcháng) is used as an adjective or adverb, often before adjectives/verbs to intensify ("extremely," "remarkably").  
- Formal register; common in written reports, science, and IT.

**Memory Aids**:  
- **异** (yì) looks like fields (田, tián) that are "different" from others.  
- **常** (cháng): Imagine a "usual" home under a roof (宀, mián); if something breaks the routine, it's **异常** (yìcháng)!
