# **始终 (shǐzhōng) - always; from beginning to end**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **始** (shǐ): Means "beginning." Left: "女" (nǚ, woman), right: "台" (tái, platform). Origin: starting something (traditionally, childbirth).  
- **终** (zhōng): Means "end." Left: "纟" (sī, silk radical) on the left, right: "冬" (dōng, winter). Origin: thread reaching the end.

**Examples**:  
- 他始终(tā shǐzhōng)坚持自己的想法。(jiānchí zìjǐ de xiǎngfǎ) - He always sticks to his own ideas.  
- 她始终(tā shǐzhōng)相信你。(xiāngxìn nǐ) - She always believes in you.  
- 问题始终(wèntí shǐzhōng)没有解决。(méiyǒu jiějué) - The problem was never solved.

**Usage Notes**:  
**始终** (shǐzhōng) emphasizes "from start to finish" or unwavering continuity. Usually used before verbs.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: **始** (shǐ, start) + **终** (zhōng, end)-from start to end = always. Imagine a thread (**终**/zhōng) stretched from the very beginning (**始**/shǐ) to the very end.
