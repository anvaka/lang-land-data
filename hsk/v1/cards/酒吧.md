# **酒吧 (jiǔbā) - bar/pub**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **酒 (jiǔ)**: "Alcohol, liquor." On the left is the "water" radical (氵, sān diǎn shuǐ), indicating liquid; on the right is "酉 (yǒu)" meaning "wine" or "fermentation vessel."  
- **吧 (bā)**: "Bar; (particle: suggestion/command)." On the left is the "mouth" radical (口, kǒu), representing speaking; the right is "巴 (bā)," which originally referred to a snake, now often used for sounds or as a phonetic component.

**Examples**:  
- 我们今晚去酒吧 (wǒmen jīnwǎn qù jiǔbā) - Let's go to the bar tonight.  
- 他在酒吧工作 (tā zài jiǔbā gōngzuò) - He works at a bar.  
- 这家酒吧很热闹 (zhè jiā jiǔbā hěn rènào) - This bar is very lively.

**Usage Notes**:  
酒吧 (jiǔbā) refers specifically to Western-style bars. For traditional Chinese "teahouse," use 茶馆 (cháguǎn).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "酒 (jiǔ) = alcohol" + "吧 (bā) = bar/ba-sound" → a place for drinking; also, "ba (吧)" sounds like "bar" in English.
