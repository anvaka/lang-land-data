# **脱 (tuō) - to take off, escape, shed**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 脱 (tuō):
  - Left: ⺼(ròu) “meat/flesh” radical - indicates relation to the body.
  - Right: 兑 (duì) - originally means “to exchange; change”; combined here for sound.

**Examples**:  
- 请把鞋脱下来。(Qǐng bǎ xié tuō xiàlái.) - Please take off your shoes.  
- 他成功地脱险了。(Tā chénggōng de tuō xiǎn le.) - He successfully escaped danger.  
- 脱衣服要先洗手。(Tuō yīfu yào xiān xǐshǒu.) - Wash your hands before taking off your clothes.

**Usage Notes**:  
脱 (tuō) is used for removing clothes/shoes or abstractly for "escape/shed." Pairs with objects: 脱衣服 (tuō yīfu - to take off clothes), 脱离 (tuōlí - to break away).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 肉 (ròu, flesh) on the left as your body, and 兑 (duì) as “changing/exchanging”-脱 (tuō) = “change from having to not having (like clothes on your body).”
