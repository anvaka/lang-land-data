# **夜 (yè) - night**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 夜 (yè): Top: 亠 (tóu, lid/cover). Middle: 亦 (yì, also); Bottom: 夂 (zhǐ, go). The "cover" over "also" and "go" suggests "covering everything"-like nightfall.

**Examples**:  
- 今晚的夜很安静。(Jīnwǎn de yè hěn ānjìng.) - The night is very quiet tonight.  
- 夜深了。(Yè shēn le.) - The night is deep.  
- 夜里我喜欢看书。(Yè lǐ wǒ xǐhuān kàn shū.) - I like to read at night.

**Usage Notes**:  
夜 (yè) is a noun, often used with 里 (lǐ, inside) as 夜里 (yè lǐ, at night) or combined in phrases like 午夜 (wǔyè, midnight).

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine a "lid" (亠, tóu) closing over the world, bringing about "also going" (亦, yì + 夂, zhǐ) to sleep during the night.
