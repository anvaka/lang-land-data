# **小说 (xiǎoshuō) - novel; fiction**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 小 (xiǎo): small; top is “⺌/小” (diminutive dots) symbolizing smallness; bottom is “小” body.  
- 说 (shuō): to speak; left is “讠”(yán) speech radical, right is “兑” (duì) meaning exchange/talk.

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢读小说。(Wǒ xǐhuān dú xiǎoshuō.) - I like to read novels.  
- 这本小说很有意思。(Zhè běn xiǎoshuō hěn yǒuyìsi.) - This novel is very interesting.  
- 他正在写一本小说。(Tā zhèngzài xiě yī běn xiǎoshuō.) - He is writing a novel.

**Usage Notes**:  
小说 (xiǎoshuō) refers to written fictional stories, usually longer works. Combine with 本 (běn) as the measure word.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: “small (小 xiǎo) + speak (说 shuō) = a little story people tell”-that’s a novel!
