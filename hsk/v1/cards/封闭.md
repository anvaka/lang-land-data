# **封闭 (fēngbì) - to seal; to close off**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **封 (fēng)**: Top is 寸 (cùn, "inch") suggesting a unit or boundary; bottom is 圭 (guī, "jade tablet"), representing formality. Full character hints at formal closure or sealing.  
- **闭 (bì)**: Left is 门 (mén, "door/gate"); right is 才 (cái, "talent"), indicating barring a door or closing an entrance.

**Examples**:  
- 这条路已经封闭了。(Zhè tiáo lù yǐjīng fēngbì le.) - This road has already been closed off.  
- 实验室暂时封闭。(Shíyànshì zànshí fēngbì.) - The laboratory is temporarily sealed.  
- 封闭环境有利于专心学习。(Fēngbì huánjìng yǒulì yú zhuānxīn xuéxí.) - A closed environment is good for focused study.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **封闭 (fēngbì)** often describes something physically sealed/shut off (rooms, packages, roads) or describes restricting access.  
- Not to confuse with **关闭 (guānbì)** ("to turn off/close" e.g., lights, computers).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a door (门 mén) shut tight with a seal (封 fēng) to "封闭 (fēngbì)" an area-nothing can get in or out.
