# **不如 (bù rú) - not as good as; it would be better to**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 不 (bù): "not"; top horizontal stroke, below is a downward right diagonal, representing negation.  
- 如 (rú): "like; as"; left: 女 (nǚ), "female" radical; right: 口 (kǒu), "mouth", indicating sound or speech-together meaning “as if.”

**Examples**:  
- 这个方法不如 (zhè ge fāngfǎ bù rú) 那个好 (nàge hǎo)。- This method is not as good as that one.  
- 雨天不如 (yǔtiān bù rú) 晴天舒服 (qíngtiān shūfu)。- Rainy days are not as comfortable as sunny days.  
- 我们不如 (wǒmen bù rú) 早点走吧 (zǎodiǎn zǒu ba)。- We might as well leave earlier.

**Usage Notes**:  
不如 (bù rú) compares two things, meaning “not as good as.” It can also suggest “might as well” before a suggestion. The structure is: A 不如 (bù rú) B + adjective.

**Memory Aids**:  
不 (bù) means “not,” and 如 (rú) means “like/as”-so together: “not like” (not as good as). Imagine a mouth (口, kǒu) on the right of 如 (rú) saying something isn't equal.
