# **中断 (zhōng duàn) - Interrupt, Break off**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **中** (zhōng): "middle," "center." Made of a vertical line passing through a rectangle (the line is "centered" inside).  
- **断** (duàn): "break," "cut off." Left side is the "斤" (jīn, axe) radical (means "axe" or "chop"), right side is "米" (mǐ, rice), indicating the act of breaking grains, hence "break off."

**Examples**:  
- 会议中断了。(huì yì zhōng duàn le.) - The meeting was interrupted.  
- 网络连接中断。(wǎng luò lián jiē zhōng duàn.) - The internet connection is cut off.  
- 请不要中断我。(qǐng bú yào zhōng duàn wǒ.) - Please don't interrupt me.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **中断** (zhōng duàn) is usually used for events, processes, or connections being interrupted or suspended unexpectedly or temporarily.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine an axe (断, duàn) cutting through the middle (中, zhōng) of something-a clear separation or interruption.
