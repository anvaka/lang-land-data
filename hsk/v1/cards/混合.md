**Character Breakdown**:  
- 混 (hùn): Left side is "氵" (shuǐ) water radical (left), right side is "昆" (kūn) meaning "elder brother" or "descendant." Here, 水 hints at liquid or mixing with water.  
- 合 (hé): Top is "亼" (jí) gather, bottom is "口" (kǒu) mouth; together, it means "to combine" or "to join together."

**Examples**:

混合 (hùn hé) is often used for tangible and intangible mixing (e.g., substances, ideas). It’s a verb; the noun form is 混合物 (hùn hé wù) for "mixture."

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 水 (shuǐ) "water" mixing into other things, and 合 (hé) "combining" them. "混 (hùn)" = "hungry" for mixing food, "合 (hé)" = harmony-blending into one.
