# **实际 (shíjì) - reality; actual; practical**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 实 (shí): "real, true." Top: 宀 (mián) "roof", bottom: 乚 (yǐ) "hidden" → something real under a roof.  
- 际 (jì): "border, boundary." Left: 阝(fù) "mound" radical, right: 祭 (jì) "offering" → where land meets an offering, suggesting an interface or boundary.

**Examples**:  
- 实际上 (shíjì shàng) - In reality; actually  
- 理论和实际 (lǐlùn hé shíjì) - theory and practice  
- 这不是实际问题 (zhè bú shì shíjì wèntí) - This is not a practical problem

**Usage Notes**:  
实际 (shíjì) is often used to compare what's real versus theoretical, abstract, or imagined. 常 paired with 上 (shàng) as 实际上 (shíjì shàng) for "in fact."

**Memory Aids**:  
实 (shí) = real things are under your roof; 际 (jì) = reality has boundaries. Together: "Real boundaries" = practical or real-world.
