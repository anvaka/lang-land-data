# **成本 (chéngběn) - Cost**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 成 (chéng): means "to become" or "to accomplish." Radical: 戈 (gē - "halberd") on the right, indicating action; top-left contains a "slash" (丿 piě) and bottom-left "earth" (土 tǔ), implying foundation.  
- 本 (běn): means "root" or "origin." Radical: 木 (mù - "tree") with a horizontal stroke at the bottom indicating the "root" or origin of the tree.

**Examples**:  
- 生产成本 (shēngchǎn chéngběn) - Production cost  
- 我们需要控制成本。(Wǒmen xūyào kòngzhì chéngběn.) - We need to control costs.  
- 成本太高，我们无法接受。(Chéngběn tài gāo, wǒmen wúfǎ jiēshòu.) - The cost is too high, we can't accept it.

**Usage Notes**:  
成(chéng)本(běn) is mainly used in business, economics, and finance to refer to the cost (financial, material, or time) of producing goods or services.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: 成(chéng) (to accomplish) + 本(běn) (origin/root) = the "original resources needed to accomplish something" - that is, the cost.
