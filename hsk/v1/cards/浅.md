# **浅 (qiǎn) - shallow; light (color)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
浅 (qiǎn):  
- Left: 氵(shuǐ, "three-dots water" radical) - indicates relation to water.  
- Right: 戋(jiān) - means "small" or "narrow," here suggesting "less depth" or "less amount," thus "shallow."

**Examples**:  
- 水很浅。(Shuǐ hěn qiǎn.) - The water is shallow.  
- 颜色很浅。(Yánsè hěn qiǎn.) - The color is light.  
- 他的知识很浅。(Tā de zhīshi hěn qiǎn.) - His knowledge is superficial.

**Usage Notes**:  
浅 (qiǎn) is used for physical shallowness (water, depth) and also for lightness (especially of color), or figuratively for superficiality.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 水 (shuǐ) on the left for water, and "small" (戋, jiān) on the right-when there's little water, it's shallow! For color, imagine a faded watercolor wash.
