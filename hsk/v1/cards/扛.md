# **扛 (káng) - to carry (on the shoulder); to shoulder**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 扛 (káng): Left - 扌(shǒu) "hand" radical, indicating an action with the hand; Right - 工 (gōng) "work," suggesting effort or labor. Together, "hand" + "work" = carrying something with effort.

**Examples**:  
- 他扛(káng)着(zhě)箱子(xiāngzi)走(zǒu)进(jìn)屋(wū)里(lǐ)。 (Tā káng zhe xiāngzi zǒu jìn wū lǐ.) - He carried the box into the house on his shoulder.  
- 她(tā)能(néng)扛(káng)起(qǐ)很(hěn)重(zhòng)的(de)袋子(dàizi)。 (Tā néng káng qǐ hěn zhòng de dàizi.) - She can shoulder very heavy bags.  
- 我(wǒ)们(men)一起(yìqǐ)扛(káng)木头(mùtou)。(Wǒmen yìqǐ káng mùtou.) - We carried the wood together.

**Usage Notes**:  
扛(káng) is mainly used for carrying long, heavy objects on the shoulder (e.g., boxes, beams). Do not use 扛(káng) for carrying with the hand or back; use 拿(ná), 背(bēi) in those cases.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 扛(káng) as "hand (扌(shǒu)) + hard work (工(gōng))": your hands are working hard to shoulder the load!
