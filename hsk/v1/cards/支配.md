- **配 (pèi):** Means "to distribute," "to match," or "to allocate." Left side is 酉 (yǒu), meaning "wine vessel" or "fermentation" (left: a container), right side is 己 (jǐ) meaning "oneself" (right: self), together suggesting "matching" or "distributing" things.

- Used in both neutral and negative (domineering) senses.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine 支 (zhī) as a hand supporting or directing, and 配 (pèi) as matching things into place; together you are "directing and arranging."
