# **物理 (wù lǐ) - Physics**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **物** (wù): "Thing/object.” The left side is 牛 (niú, "cow/ox") on top, indicating the radical, and the right side is 勿 (wù, “not”), forming the phonetic part.  
- **理** (lǐ): "Principle/reason.” The left is 王 (wáng, "king/jade") as the radical, while the right is 里 (lǐ, “village/inside”), serving as the phonetic component.

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢学习物理。(Wǒ xǐhuān xuéxí wùlǐ.) - I like studying physics.  
- 物理老师很严格。(Wùlǐ lǎoshī hěn yángé.) - The physics teacher is very strict.  
- 他在大学学物理。(Tā zài dàxué xué wùlǐ.) - He studies physics at university.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 物理 (wùlǐ) refers specifically to the science of physics, not "physical" or "thing-reason" in general.  
- Used for both the field (physics) and as an adjective for things related to physical science, e.g. 物理学 (wùlǐxué, "physics" as subject).

**Memory Aids**:  
- 物 (wù): Think of "cows" (牛 niú) as tangible things.  
- 理 (lǐ): The "king" (王 wáng) organizes "villages" (里 lǐ) - as physics organizes how things work.
