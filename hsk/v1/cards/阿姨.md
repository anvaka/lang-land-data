# **阿姨 (ā yí) - aunt; woman of mother's age**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **阿** (ā): On the left is the "阝" (fù) radical (right-side form, meaning mound or city) and on the right is "可" (kě), which means "can" or "able." Prefix used before kinship terms or names.  
- **姨** (yí): Left side "女" (nǚ, woman/female) radical, right side "夷" (yí, ancient tribe); together indicating female relative, specifically mother's side.

**Examples**:  
- 阿姨(ā yí)，您好！(ā yí, nín hǎo!) - Hello, Auntie!  
- 她是我的阿姨。(tā shì wǒ de ā yí.) - She is my aunt.  
- 阿姨(ā yí)在厨房做饭。(ā yí zài chú fáng zuò fàn.) - Auntie is cooking in the kitchen.

**Usage Notes**:  
阿姨(ā yí) can refer to mother’s sister, a woman of similar age to one’s mother, or sometimes a female helper (e.g., nanny, housekeeper). Used respectfully for women older than the speaker.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine 阿(ā) as a friendly "prefix" that opens many family words, and 姨(yí) as "female" (女 nǚ) plus "tribe" (夷 yí) = female relative, usually mother's side.
