# **谜语 (mí yǔ) - Riddle**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **谜** (mí): "riddle", left side is **讠** (yán) "speech" radical, right side is **迷** (mí), "confused" or "bewildered" without the left radical. Implies confusing speech.  
- **语** (yǔ): "language" or "speech", left side is **讠** (yán) "speech" radical, right side is **吾** (wú), "I" or "me". Refers to things spoken.

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢猜谜语。(Wǒ xǐhuān cāi míyǔ.) - I like to guess riddles.  
- 你会写谜语吗？(Nǐ huì xiě míyǔ ma?) - Can you write riddles?  
- 老师给我们讲了一个谜语。(Lǎoshī gěi wǒmen jiǎng le yí gè míyǔ.) - The teacher told us a riddle.

**Usage Notes**:  
谜语 (míyǔ) usually refers to a word puzzle or brain teaser. Often used with verbs like 猜 (cāi-to guess), 写 (xiě-to write), or 说 (shuō-to tell).

**Memory Aids**:  
Both 谜 (mí) and 语 (yǔ) share the 讠 (yán) "speech" radical: riddles are "confusing language." Remember: 谜 (mí) = mystery + 语 (yǔ) = language = “mystery language.”
