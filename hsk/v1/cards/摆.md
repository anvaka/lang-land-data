# **摆 (bǎi) - to place, to arrange**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 摆 (bǎi): Left side is 扌(shǒu, "hand" radical, left), suggesting an action with the hand. Right side is 罢 (bà, "stop/cease", right), giving pronunciation and a subtle hint of arrangement or stoppage.

**Examples**:  
- 请把书摆(bǎi)在桌子上。(Qǐng bǎ shū bǎi zài zhuōzi shàng.) - Please place the book on the table.  
- 他把椅子摆(bǎi)得很整齐。(Tā bǎ yǐzi bǎi de hěn zhěngqí.) - He arranged the chairs neatly.  
- 摆(bǎi)好姿势拍照。(Bǎi hǎo zīshì pāi zhào.) - Pose well for the photo.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 摆(bǎi) is commonly used with physical objects, sometimes metaphorically (e.g., 摆(bǎi)姿势 zīshì, "strike a pose").  
- Often used with 把(bǎ) sentence structure for placement.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 扌(shǒu, hand) + 罢(bà, stop/arrange): Use your "hand" to "stop" and place something where it belongs-thus, "to arrange" or "to place."
