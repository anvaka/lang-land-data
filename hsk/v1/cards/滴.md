**Character Breakdown**:  
- **滴 (dī)**:
  - Left: 氵(shuǐ) "water" radical, hints at something liquid-related.
  - Right: 敫(jiǎo), here for phonetic value; top-right is 白(bái) "white", and bottom-right 攵(pū) suggests movement/action.

**Memory Aids**:  
- The three dots of 氵(shuǐ) left radical look like drops of water.  
- Think “滴 (dī) = drip!” - the sound hints at a falling drop.
