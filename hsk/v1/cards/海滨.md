# **海滨 (hǎibīn) - Seaside / Seashore**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **海 (hǎi)**: Means "sea." The left side is the three-dot water radical (氵, shuǐ, left), indicating relation to water; the right side is 每 (měi, right), which functions phonetically here.  
- **滨 (bīn)**: Means "shore" or "edge." The left side is the three-dot water radical (氵, shuǐ, left); the right side is 兵 (bīng, right), used for sound.

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢在海滨(hǎibīn)散步。(Wǒ xǐhuān zài hǎibīn sànbù.) - I like to take walks along the seaside.  
- 海滨(hǎibīn)城市很受游客欢迎。(Hǎibīn chéngshì hěn shòu yóukè huānyíng.) - Seaside cities are very popular with tourists.  
- 他们住在海滨(hǎibīn)别墅里。(Tāmen zhù zài hǎibīn biéshù lǐ.) - They live in a villa by the seashore.

**Usage Notes**:  
海滨(hǎibīn) is often used as an attributive word: 海滨(hǎibīn)城市/公园 ("seaside city"/"seaside park"). It’s more formal/literary than 海边(hǎibiān).

**Memory Aids**:  
Both 海(hǎi) and 滨(bīn) have the water radical 氵(shuǐ, left), reminding you "seaside" means "by the water."  
滨(bīn): Think of "bin" as putting something "at the edge," matching "shore."
