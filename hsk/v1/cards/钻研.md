# **钻研 (zuān yán) - To study intensely; to delve into**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 钻 (zuān): on the left, "钅(jīn)" radical (metal) suggests something hard; right side "占(zhān)" (to occupy). Originally associated with drilling or penetrating.  
- 研 (yán): top "石(shí)" (stone) radical (relates to grinding or studying); bottom "开(kāi)" (open). Historically means to grind (as in inkstone), now extended to studying deeply.

**Examples**:  
- 他(tā)一直(yì zhí)钻研(zuān yán)这个(zhè ge)课题(kè tí)。(Tā yì zhí zuān yán zhè ge kè tí.) - He has been delving into this topic.  
- 她(tā)喜欢(xǐ huān)钻研(zuān yán)难题(nán tí)。(Tā xǐ huān zuān yán nán tí.) - She likes to work on tough problems.  
- 科学家(kē xué jiā)们(men)正在(zhèng zài)钻研(zuān yán)新技术(xīn jì shù)。(Kē xué jiā men zhèng zài zuān yán xīn jì shù.) - Scientists are researching new technologies.

**Usage Notes**:  
- Often used with academic or technical fields.  
- Implies persistence and depth of study or research.
