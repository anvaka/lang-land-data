# **擅自 (shànzì) - Without authorization; unauthorized**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 擅 (shàn): Means "to act arbitrarily" or "without permission." Left: 扌(shǒu, hand radical) suggests action; right: 肪 (fáng, component) phonetically hints at pronunciation.  
- 自 (zì): Means "self." Top: 目(mù, eye component); bottom: a line, showing the nose in ancient script, representing oneself.

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 擅自 (shànzì) 进入 (jìnrù) 了 (le) 实验室 (shíyànshì)。 (He entered the lab without permission.)  
- 请 (qǐng) 不要 (bùyào) 擅自 (shànzì) 修改 (xiūgǎi) 文件 (wénjiàn)。 (Please do not change the document without authorization.)  
- 擅自 (shànzì) 离开 (líkāi) 岗位 (gǎngwèi) 会 (huì) 被 (bèi) 处罚 (chǔfá)。 (Leaving the post without permission will be punished.)

**Usage Notes**:  
- Often used before verbs to mean "do (something) without approval." Formal/regulatory tone.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 擅 (shàn) has 扌(shǒu, hand) - imagine a hand acting alone. 自 (zì) is "self." Picture someone acting by themselves, without asking!
