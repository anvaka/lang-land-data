# **本质 (běn zhì) - Essence; nature; intrinsic quality**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **本 (běn)**: root, origin. Top: 木 (mù, wood), with a short horizontal stroke at the bottom, marking the "base" or "root" of a tree.  
- **质 (zhì)**: quality, substance. Left: 贺 (hè, but simplified here, radical denotes shell/money, 贝/bèi, at the bottom), Right: 斤 (jīn, axe) on the right. Suggests “substance” resulting in “value.”

**Examples**:  
- 我们讨论问题的本质。(Wǒmen tǎolùn wèntí de běnzhì.) - We discuss the essence of the problem.  
- 爱的本质是关心。(Ài de běnzhì shì guānxīn.) - The essence of love is caring.  
- 你要了解事情的本质。(Nǐ yào liǎojiě shìqíng de běnzhì.) - You need to understand the nature of the matter.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **本质 (běnzhì)** is noun-only, used for core attributes, not outward appearances.  
- Common structures: "X的本质 (X de běnzhì)" = "essence of X".

**Memory Aids**:  
- **本 (běn)** is a tree with its roots; **质 (zhì)** is the value (贝/bèi) of what's inside. "Essence" is like the root value of something.
