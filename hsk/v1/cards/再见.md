# **再见 (zài jiàn) - Goodbye**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 再 (zài): Means "again." The top is "一" (yī, one), the middle is "冂" (jiōng, an enclosure from left, bottom, right), and the bottom is "土" (tǔ, earth).  
- 见 (jiàn): Means "to see." The left is "儿" (ér, child/legs), and the right is a modified "目" (mù, eye) without the top and bottom lines.

**Examples**:  
- 我们明天再见。(Wǒmen míngtiān zài jiàn.) - We'll see each other again tomorrow.  
- 老师，再见！(Lǎoshī, zài jiàn!) - Goodbye, teacher!  
- 下次再见。(Xià cì zài jiàn.) - See you next time.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 再见 (zài jiàn) is the standard way to say "goodbye" in Chinese. It's polite and suitable in most situations, but not very formal.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think "再 (zài, again)" + "见 (jiàn, see)" = "See you again!"  
- Imagine waving and saying you'll meet again, not just leaving forever.
