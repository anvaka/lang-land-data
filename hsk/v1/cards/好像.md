# **好像 (hǎoxiàng) - seem; look like**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **好** (hǎo): Means "good" or "well." Composed of 女 (nǚ, woman) on the left and 子 (zǐ, child) on the right.  
- **像** (xiàng): Means "to resemble" or "image." Left side 亻 (rén, person radical), right side 象 (xiàng, elephant); 象 (xiàng) represents both "elephant" and "appearance."

**Examples**:  
- 她( tā )好像( hǎoxiàng )生病了( shēngbìng le )。(Tā hǎoxiàng shēngbìng le.) - She seems sick.  
- 我( wǒ )好像( hǎoxiàng )见过你( jiànguò nǐ )。(Wǒ hǎoxiàng jiànguò nǐ.) - I think I’ve seen you before.  
- 外面( wàimiàn )好像( hǎoxiàng )要下雨了( yào xià yǔ le )。(Wàimiàn hǎoxiàng yào xià yǔ le.) - It looks like it’s going to rain outside.

**Usage Notes**:  
好像( hǎoxiàng ) is used before verbs or at the start of sentences to express "seems like" or "looks like." Can be followed by full clauses or adjectives.

**Memory Aids**:  
"好( hǎo )" (good) + "像( xiàng )" (looks like) = "It looks good/like…", so 好像( hǎoxiàng ) is used when something seems to resemble or appear a certain way.
