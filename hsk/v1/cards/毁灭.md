# **毁灭 (huǐ miè) - to destroy, to ruin, to annihilate**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **毁 (huǐ)**: Left: 扌(shǒu, "hand" radical), Right: 毁 (huǐ, "to destroy"; includes components like 殳(shū, "weapon" at right-bottom), reflecting action with the hand).  
- **灭 (miè)**: Top: 灬(huǒ, "fire" radical stylized at bottom), Above: 乂(yì, "to control/cut" at top); overall meaning "to put out a fire" → to extinguish/destroy.

**Examples**:  
- 这座城市被毁灭了。(Zhè zuò chéngshì bèi huǐmiè le.) - This city was destroyed.  
- 战争带来了毁灭。(Zhànzhēng dàilái le huǐmiè.) - War brought destruction.  
- 不要毁灭自己的梦想。(Bùyào huǐmiè zìjǐ de mèngxiǎng.) - Don’t destroy your own dreams.

**Usage Notes**:  
毁灭 (huǐmiè) is more formal and emphasizes total destruction or annihilation, often of large-scale things (e.g. environments, hopes, buildings). Used both literally and metaphorically.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: Hand (扌shǒu) with a weapon (殳shū) can destroy (毁huǐ), and putting out (乂yì) a fire (灬huǒ) means to extinguish (灭miè), thus *total destruction*.
