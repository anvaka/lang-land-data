# **操作 (cāozuò) - Operation; to operate/manipulate**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **操 (cāo)**: Left side is 扌 (shǒu, hand radical, left), indicates "action by hand." Right side is 曹 (cáo), suggesting sound and sometimes meaning "group" or "manage."  
- **作 (zuò)**: Left is 亻 (rén, person radical, left), right is 乍 (zhà), meaning "sudden," but here indicates action-together suggests "people doing/making."

**Examples**:  
- 请操作电脑。(Qǐng cāozuò diànnǎo.) - Please operate the computer.  
- 操作机器时要小心。(Cāozuò jīqì shí yào xiǎoxīn.) - Be careful when operating machines.  
- 这个系统很容易操作。(Zhège xìtǒng hěn róngyì cāozuò.) - This system is easy to operate.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 操作 (cāozuò) is mainly used for machines, systems, devices, or programs-not usually for people or animals.  
- Can be both noun ("an operation") and verb ("to operate").

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine 用手 (yòng shǒu, using a hand) to 做 (zuò, do) something = 操作 (cāozuò, operate).  
- 操 (cāo) = hands + manage; 作 (zuò) = person + act. Together: Hands directing actions.
