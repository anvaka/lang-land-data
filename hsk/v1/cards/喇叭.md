# **喇叭 (lǎ ba) - trumpet; horn; loudspeaker**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **喇** (lǎ): Left: 口 (kǒu, "mouth" radical) represents sound; right: 剌 (là/lā, "to cut/prick"), used for phonetic value.  
- **叭** (ba): Left: 口 (kǒu, "mouth" radical) again for sound; right: 巴 (bā, "to stick/to hope") provides pronunciation.

**Examples**:  
- 请把喇叭(lǎ ba)关掉。(Qǐng bǎ lǎ ba guān diào.) - Please turn off the loudspeaker.  
- 他的车喇叭(lǎ ba)声音很大。(Tā de chē lǎ ba shēng yīn hěn dà.) - His car horn is very loud.  
- 老师在用喇叭(lǎ ba)讲话。(Lǎo shī zài yòng lǎ ba jiǎng huà.) - The teacher is speaking through a loudspeaker.

**Usage Notes**:  
喇叭(lǎ ba) refers to any sound device like a trumpet, car horn, or loudspeaker, depending on context. Often used as a noun.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 口(kǒu, "mouth") in both characters: a horn makes sound using a "mouth." "叭"(ba) sounds like "ba!"-an abrupt noise, just like a horn!
