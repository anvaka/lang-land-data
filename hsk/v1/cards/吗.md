# **吗 (ma) - (question particle)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 吗 (ma):
  - Left: 口 (kǒu) "mouth"
  - Right: 马 (mǎ) "horse"
  - Radical is 口 (kǒu, mouth) on the left; indicates sound/speech.

**Examples**:  
- 你好吗？(nǐ hǎo ma?) - How are you?  
- 这是你的书吗？(zhè shì nǐ de shū ma?) - Is this your book?  
- 你会说中文吗？(nǐ huì shuō zhōng wén ma?) - Can you speak Chinese?

**Usage Notes**:  
吗 (ma) turns a statement into a yes-no question. Place 吗 (ma) at the end of the sentence-do not use with question words (e.g., 什么 (shénme), 谁 (shéi)).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: When you "open your mouth" (口 kǒu, mouth) and say "ma," you’re asking for an answer-so 吗 (ma) signals a question!
