# **偏偏 (piān piān) - just (when contrary to expectation); insist on; nevertheless**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **偏** (piān): "inclined," "partial." Left: **亻** (rén, person radical), right: **扁** (biǎn, flat). Implies leaning or not straightforward.  
- **偏** (piān) (repeated): Indicates emphasis-serves to intensify the sense of "just (in spite of)."

**Examples**:  
- 她(Tā) 偏偏(piānpiān) 不(bù) 听(tīng) 我的(wǒde) 劝告(quàngào)。 (Tā piānpiān bù tīng wǒde quàngào.) - She just refuses to listen to my advice.  
- 偏偏(piānpiān) 今天(jīntiān) 下雨(xiàyǔ)！(Piānpiān jīntiān xià yǔ!) - It just had to rain today!

**Usage Notes**:  
- Often used for emphasis when something happens against wishes or expectations.  
- Usually appears before verbs or entire clauses.  
- Common in spoken and written Chinese to express frustration or irony.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Double **偏** (piān) like someone leaning twice-stubbornly going the "opposite way."  
- Imagine a person (**亻** (rén)) deliberately taking a slanted (**偏** (piān)) path, not the straight one you hope.
