# **爱 (ài) - Love**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 爱 (ài): Top: 爫 (zhǎo, "claw"); Middle: 冖 (mì, "cover") and 心 (xīn, "heart", here stylized at the bottom). The components together can hint at "a hand covering a heart," symbolizing love or care.

**Examples**:  
- 我爱你。(Wǒ ài nǐ.) - I love you.  
- 她爱唱歌。(Tā ài chànggē.) - She loves singing.  
- 爱是一种力量。(Ài shì yī zhǒng lìliàng.) - Love is a kind of strength.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 爱 (ài) is both a noun ("love") and a verb ("to love").  
- Less commonly used to express romantic love in daily Chinese; often replaced by 喜欢 (xǐhuān) for less intense affection.  
- Used for family, hobbies, and actions.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a "hand/claw" (爫 zhǎo) gently protecting a "heart" (心 xīn) as a symbol of love (爱 ài).  
- 爱 (ài) sounds like "eye", reminding you to "see" with love.
