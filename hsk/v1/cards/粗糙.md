# **粗糙 (cū cāo) - Rough / Coarse**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **粗 (cū)**: Left side is 米 (mǐ, rice); right side is 且 (qiě, moreover). "Rice" (米) suggests graininess, related to roughness/textures.  
- **糙 (cāo)**: Top is 米 (mǐ, rice); bottom is 造 (zào, to make/build). The 米 (mǐ) again hints at granular texture; 造 (zào) implies formation, giving a sense of something made in a rough or unrefined way.

**Examples**:  
- 这块布很粗糙 (Zhè kuài bù hěn cū cāo) - This cloth is very rough.  
- 他的说话方式有点粗糙 (Tā de shuōhuà fāngshì yǒudiǎn cū cāo) - His way of speaking is a bit coarse.  
- 这里的道路非常粗糙 (Zhèlǐ de dàolù fēicháng cū cāo) - The road here is very bumpy/uneven.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 粗糙 (cū cāo) describes physical textures (fabric, surfaces), and also abstract things (language, work), meaning unrefined or lacking polish.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Both characters use 米 (mǐ, rice), reminding you of the rough/grainy feeling of uncooked rice-just like something 粗糙 (cū cāo).  
- Think: "cū cāo" sounds like "coarse," which matches the meaning!
