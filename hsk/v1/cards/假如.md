# **假如 (jiǎ rú) - if; suppose**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 假 (jiǎ): on the left, 亻(rén) "person" radical; right, 叚(jiǎ) "false, fake". Means "false," "pretend," or "borrow."  
- 如 (rú): left, 女(nǚ) "woman" radical; right, 口(kǒu) "mouth". Means "like," "as if," or "if."

**Examples**:  
- 假如(jiǎ rú)你(nǐ)有(yǒu)时间(shí jiān)，请(qǐng)来(lái)我(wǒ)家(jiā)。 (If you have time, please come to my house.)  
- 假如(jiǎ rú)明天(míng tiān)下雨(xià yǔ)，我们(wǒ men)就(jiù)不(bù)去(qù)了(le)。 (If it rains tomorrow, we won’t go.)  
- 假如(jiǎ rú)我是(wǒ shì)你(nǐ)，我(wǒ)会(huì)努力(nǔ lì)。 (If I were you, I would work hard.)

**Usage Notes**:  
假如(jiǎ rú) is formal and often used in written or serious speech, introducing hypothetical clauses. Equivalent to "if" or "suppose that." Often followed by 就(jiù) in the next clause ("then").

**Memory Aids**:  
假(jiǎ) = "pretend/fake" → imagine a "pretend" situation; 如(rú) = "like/as if" → as if something is true. "Pretend as if" = "If/suppose."
