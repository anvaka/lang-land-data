# **比例 (bǐ lì) - proportion; ratio**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **比** (bǐ): "to compare." Left: "匕" (bǐ) meaning "spoon/knife" shape. Indicates comparison, as if sizing up two things.  
- **例** (lì): "example." Left: "亻" (rén) person radical, right: "列" (liè), meaning "to arrange." Suggests a person in an arrangement-one of many examples.

**Examples**:  
- 他们的收入比例(bǐ lì)很大。(Tāmen de shōurù bǐlì hěn dà.) - Their income ratio is large.  
- 男女比例(nán nǚ bǐ lì)是一比一。(Nán nǚ bǐ lì shì yī bǐ yī.) - The male-to-female ratio is 1:1.  
- 价格和质量成正比例(jiàgé hé zhìliàng chéng zhèng bǐlì)。 (Jiàgé hé zhìliàng chéng zhèng bǐlì.) - Price and quality are directly proportional.

**Usage Notes**:  
比例(bǐ lì) is used for mathematical, statistical, or comparative ratios. Often followed by numbers, such as 2:1 (二比一 èr bǐ yī).

**Memory Aids**:  
- 比(bǐ) looks like two things side by side-think "comparison."  
- 例(lì) is "example"; "比例(bǐ lì)" is the "example" (例 lÌ) way to "compare" (比 bǐ) two things: by their ratio.
