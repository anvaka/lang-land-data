# **总统 (zǒng tǒng) - president**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **总 (zǒng)**: “overall; chief.” Top: “糸 (mì)” meaning "silk", suggesting coordination. Bottom: “公 (gōng)” meaning "public." Together, implies someone who oversees.  
- **统 (tǒng)**: “to govern; unify.” Left: “糸 (mì)” for "silk/thread"; right: “充 (chōng)” meaning "to fill." Indicates gathering threads together-unifying.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think “总 (zǒng)” = chief + “统 (tǒng)” = unifier. The president is the chief who unifies the country.
