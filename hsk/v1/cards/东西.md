# **东西 (dōngxi) - thing; stuff**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **东 (dōng)**: east. Top = "一 (yī)" (one); bottom = "小 (xiǎo)" (small), indicating the sun rising in the east.  
- **西 (xī)**: west. Enclosed = a pictograph of a bird in a nest at sunset, symbolizing the west.

**Examples**:  
- 你(nǐ)喜欢(xǐhuan)买(mǎi)东西(dōngxi)吗(ma)? (Do you like to buy things?)  
- 我(wǒ)忘了(wàng le)带(dài)东西(dōngxi)。 (I forgot to bring things.)  
- 这些(zhèxiē)东西(dōngxi)很(hěn)贵(guì)。 (These things are expensive.)

**Usage Notes**:  
- 东西(dōngxi) refers to tangible or intangible "things" or "stuff."  
- Sometimes used as a slang insult ("person" in a negative way) - avoid in that context.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 东(dōng) and 西(xī) - "east" and "west." If you have things, you might collect them from east to west - all sorts of "stuff."
