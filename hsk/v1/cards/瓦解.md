# **瓦解 (wǎ jiě) - To disintegrate; collapse; break up**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **瓦** (wǎ): Top component is “冖” (mì, cover radical), bottom right is “一” (yī, one), inside is “丶” (zhǔ, dot). Means “tile”-fragile, easily broken.  
- **解** (jiě): Left side is “角” (jiǎo, horn), right side is “刀” (dāo, knife) on the bottom and “牛” (niú, cow) on the top. Means “to untie, solve, disassemble”.

**Examples**:  
- 这个组织瓦解了。(Zhè ge zǔ zhī wǎ jiě le.) - This organization has disintegrated.  
- 敌军很快被瓦解。(Dí jūn hěn kuài bèi wǎ jiě.) - The enemy troops were quickly broken up.  
- 谣言能让信任瓦解。(Yáo yán néng ràng xìn rèn wǎ jiě.) - Rumors can cause trust to collapse.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **瓦解** (wǎ jiě) is often used metaphorically for breaking up groups, organizations, or intangible things like trust and control, rather than physical objects.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine **瓦** (wǎ, tile) breaking, and **解** (jiě, untie) as taking things apart-together: “broken apart.”
