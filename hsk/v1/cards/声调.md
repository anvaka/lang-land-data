# **声调 (shēngdiào) - Tone**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 声 (shēng): "sound"; left: 士 (shì, scholar) + right: 曰 (yuē, speak)-suggests speaking or a voice.  
- 调 (diào): "tone/melody"; left: 讠 (yán, speech radical) + right: 周 (zhōu, circumference)-related to speech and musical tones.

**Examples**:  
- 汉语有四个声调。(Hànyǔ yǒu sì gè shēngdiào.) - Chinese has four tones.  
- 这个字的声调很难记。(Zhège zì de shēngdiào hěn nán jì.) - The tone of this character is hard to remember.  
- 请注意声调的变化。(Qǐng zhùyì shēngdiào de biànhuà.) - Please pay attention to the tone changes.

**Usage Notes**:  
声调 (shēngdiào) refers specifically to the pitch contour of a syllable in Mandarin. It is crucial for differentiating meanings. Used in language learning, musical contexts, or linguistics.

**Memory Aids**:  
“声 (shēng)” = "sound" + “调 (diào)” = "melody," so 声调 (shēngdiào) is the "melody" (tone) of a "sound." Imagine each syllable in Chinese singing its own "mini-song."
