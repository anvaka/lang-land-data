# **飘 (piāo) - to float; to flutter**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 飘 (piāo): Left = 飠/饣 (shí, food radical) often related to eating/air/scent; Right = 票 (piào, ticket), here borrowing sound and suggesting lightness. The food radical on the left, the “ticket” on the right.

**Examples**:  
- 风筝在空中飘 (Fēngzheng zài kōngzhōng piāo) - The kite floats in the sky.  
- 落叶慢慢飘下来 (Luòyè mànmàn piāo xiàlái) - The leaves slowly drift down.  
- 香味飘进了房间 (Xiāngwèi piāo jìnle fángjiān) - The fragrance floated into the room.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 飘 (piāo) describes light, drifting motion (wind, scent, hair, clouds). Usually intransitive (no object needed).  
- Not for heavy objects; for gentle, airy movement.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a ticket (票 piào) being blown lightly by the wind, floating/飘 (piāo) in the air.  
- 饣(shí) on the left: think of scents “floating” from food.
