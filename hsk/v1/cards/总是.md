# **总是 (zǒng shì) - always**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **总 (zǒng)**: "always; overall." Top: 糸(mì - silk), referring to thread or linking; bottom: 公(gōng - public, together), suggesting gathering together.  
- **是 (shì)**: "is, to be." Top: 日(rì - sun); bottom: 正(zhèng - correct), originally meaning "this is correct" or "it is so".

**Examples**:  
- 我(wǒ)总是(zǒng shì)忘记(wàng jì)带(dài)钥匙(yào shi)。 (Wǒ zǒng shì wàng jì dài yào shi.) - I always forget to bring the keys.  
- 他(tā)总是(zǒng shì)很(hěn)忙(máng)。 (Tā zǒng shì hěn máng.) - He is always very busy.  
- 天气(tiān qì)总是(zǒng shì)在(zài)春天(chūn tiān)变化(biàn huà)很大(hěn dà)。 (Tiān qì zǒng shì zài chūn tiān biàn huà hěn dà.) - The weather always changes a lot in spring.

**Usage Notes**:  
总是(zǒng shì) is used before the verb or adjective to indicate a repeated or consistent action/state. Slightly more formal than 老(lǎo - always), but common in speech.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine 总(zǒng) as "gathering (together) threads of time" and 是(shì) as "it is," so 总是(zǒng shì) means "it is always the case."
