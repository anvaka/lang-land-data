# **地步 (dì bù) - Situation; extent; state (often negative)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **地 (dì)**: "Earth; ground." The radical 土 (tǔ, earth) is on the left, and 也 (yě, also) is on the right.  
- **步 (bù)**: "Step." The radical 止 (zhǐ, stop) is on top and 少 (shǎo, few) is on bottom.

**Examples**:  
- 事情没有到无法解决的地步。(Shìqíng méiyǒu dào wúfǎ jiějué de dìbù.) - The situation hasn't reached an unsolvable point.  
- 他穷到了没饭吃的地步。(Tā qióng dào le méi fàn chī de dìbù.) - He's poor to the extent of having nothing to eat.  
- 我没想到事情会变成这样地步。(Wǒ méi xiǎngdào shìqíng huì biànchéng zhèyàng dìbù.) - I didn't expect things would get to this extent.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **地步 (dìbù)** often describes a certain condition or degree, especially a bad or difficult state.  
- Usually follows 到 (dào, to reach) or such verbs.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine **地 (dì, ground)** and **步 (bù, step)**: "step of ground" → the place or situation you step into.  
- Reaching a "地步 (dìbù)" is like reaching a (sometimes problematic) point along the road.
