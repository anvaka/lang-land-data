# **刚 (gāng) - just; barely; hard/firm**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 刚 (gāng): Left side is "刂" (dāo) knife radical; right side is "冈" (gāng) meaning "ridge." The knife radical on the right (originally top in traditional form) suggests something sharp/hard.

**Examples**:  
- 我刚到。(Wǒ gāng dào.) - I just arrived.  
- 他刚才走了。(Tā gāngcái zǒu le.) - He just left a moment ago.  
- 天刚亮。(Tiān gāng liàng.) - It's just getting light (dawn).

**Usage Notes**:  
- 刚 (gāng) is often placed before verbs to express actions that happened only a short time ago.  
- Different from 刚才 (gāngcái), which refers specifically to the recent past ("just now").

**Memory Aids**:  
- 刚 (gāng) with the knife radical means something is as sharp/quick as a knife-just happened. Imagine "just cutting" into a moment!
