# **哪 (nǎ) - which; where**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 哪 (nǎ):
  - Radical: 口 (kǒu - mouth, on the left)
  - Second part: 那 (nà - that, on the right), which itself contains 大 (dà - big, at the top) over 阝 (fù - ear or mound, on the right side).
  - The radical suggests relation to speech or questioning.

**Examples**:  
- 你是哪国人？(nǐ shì nǎ guó rén?) - Which country are you from?  
- 哪个是你的？(nǎ ge shì nǐ de?) - Which one is yours?  
- 他去哪儿？(tā qù nǎr?) - Where is he going?

**Usage Notes**:  
- 哪 (nǎ) is used to form questions about options (which) or place (where), usually followed by classifiers/ge (个, gè) or nouns.  
- Often appears in question words: 哪里 (nǎ lǐ - where), 哪儿 (nǎr - where, especially in northern China).

**Memory Aids**:  
- 哪 (nǎ) looks similar to 那 (nà - that), so think: "Which (哪, nǎ) one? Not that (那, nà) one!"  
- The 口 (kǒu - mouth) radical hints it's a question word (you ask with your mouth).
