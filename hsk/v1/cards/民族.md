**Character Breakdown**:  
- **民 (mín)**: means “people” or “citizen”; the top is “氓” (máng, means ‘commoner’), the bottom is “氏” (shì, clan surname), together representing common people.  
- **族 (zú)**: means “clan; ethnic group”; on the left is the “方 (fāng, square)” radical, and on the right is “矢 (shǐ, arrow)”, suggesting people grouped (like arrows in a quiver).
