# **多 (duō) - many; much; more**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 多 (duō): Top component is 夕 (xī, evening); bottom is another 夕 (xī). The doubling suggests "many" or "more." It originates from two evenings, meaning "many nights" implies a lot.

**Examples**:  
- 你有多少？(nǐ yǒu duō shǎo?) - How many do you have?  
- 太多了！(tài duō le!) - That's too much!  
- 多谢！(duō xiè!) - Thank you very much!

**Usage Notes**:  
- 多 (duō) acts as an adjective/adverb for "many" or "much." Common with 么 (me) as in 多少 (duō shǎo, how many/much); often appears before nouns or verbs.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Two 夕 (xī, evenings) = more time = "many/much."  
- Imagine two moons (evenings) means a lot-the more, the merrier!
