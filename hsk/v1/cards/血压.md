# **血压 (xuè yā) - blood pressure**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **血** (xuè): blood. Composed of "皿" (mǐn, dish/bowl) at the bottom and drops at the top representing blood dripping into a vessel.  
- **压** (yā): pressure. Left side is "厂" (chǎng, factory/cliff), top of the right is "亚" (yà, sub-), together giving the idea of pressing down from above.

**Examples**:  
- 医生量了我的血压。(Yīshēng liángle wǒ de xuè yā.) - The doctor measured my blood pressure.  
- 他的血压很高。(Tā de xuè yā hěn gāo.) - His blood pressure is high.  
- 你需要控制你的血压。(Nǐ xūyào kòngzhì nǐ de xuè yā.) - You need to control your blood pressure.

**Usage Notes**:  
"血压" (xuè yā) is a medical term used for both clinical and daily health contexts. Usually paired with adjectives like "高" (gāo, high) or "低" (dī, low).

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine "血" (xuè, blood) under "压" (yā, pressure): blood under pressure = blood pressure!
