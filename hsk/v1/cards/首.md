# **首 (shǒu) - head; first; chief**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **首 (shǒu)**: The radical at the top is “⺧” (niú, ox/cow), but here it's stylized as a component hinting at a face or head. The bottom part “自” (zì) resembles a nose, further emphasizing "head" or "face".

**Examples**:  
- 他是校首 (tā shì xiào shǒu) - He is the head of the school.  
- 首先，我们来讨论计划 (shǒu xiān, wǒ men lái tǎo lùn jì huà) - First, let's discuss the plan.  
- 这首歌很流行 (zhè shǒu gē hěn liú xíng) - This song is very popular.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **首 (shǒu)** can mean "head" (literal or metaphorical), "first," or is used as a classifier for poems or songs (e.g., 一首诗 yī shǒu shī - one poem).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine the top as hair and the bottom as a face/nose-together, they form a "head" (shǒu).
