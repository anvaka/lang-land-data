# **姓 (xìng) - surname; family name**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 姓 (xìng): On the left is 女 (nǚ, "woman/female"), and on the right is 生 (shēng, "to be born"). Suggests the family name one is born with, historically connecting "woman" and "birth."

**Examples**:  
- 请问您姓什么？(Qǐng wèn nín xìng shén me?) - May I ask your surname?  
- 我姓王。(Wǒ xìng Wáng.) - My surname is Wang.  
- 你姓李吗？(Nǐ xìng Lǐ ma?) - Is your surname Li?

**Usage Notes**:  
姓 (xìng) is both a noun ("surname") and a verb ("to be surnamed"). Used before your family name, not given name. In polite questions, add 贵 (guì, "honorable") as: 您贵姓？(Nín guì xìng?)-What is your (honorable) surname?

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "A woman (女 nǚ) gives (生 shēng) birth to the family name (姓 xìng)." Connect birth and family name.
