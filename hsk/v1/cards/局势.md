# **局势 (jú shì) - Situation; State of Affairs**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 局 (jú): "Situation; bureau" - Radical: 尸 (shī) [top], component: 口 (kǒu) [bottom inside]. Originally a chessboard, now extended to "situation" or "arrangement."  
- 势 (shì): "Power; trend" - Radical: 力 (lì) [bottom], shape component: 埶 (yì) [top]. Implies force or momentum in a certain direction.

**Examples**:  
- 当前的局势很复杂。(dāng qián de jú shì hěn fù zá.) - The current situation is very complicated.  
- 局势发生了变化。(jú shì fā shēng le biàn huà.) - The situation has changed.  
- 我们需要关注国际局势。(wǒ men xū yào guān zhù guó jì jú shì.) - We need to pay attention to the international situation.

**Usage Notes**:  
局势 (jú shì) is mostly used for broad situations (political, economic, etc.), not for personal matters. Combine with verbs like 变化 (biàn huà), 稳定 (wěn dìng), or 紧张 (jǐn zhāng).

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine a 局 (jú) chessboard as the "setting," and 势 (shì) as the "forces" or trends on that board-together indicating how things stand.
