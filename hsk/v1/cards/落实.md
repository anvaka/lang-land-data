# **落实 (luòshí) - Implement; Put into practice**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 落 (luò): Means "to fall, to descend." Left: 艹 (cǎo) radical on top ("grass/plant"), right: 洛 (luò), often related to water and motion.  
- 实 (shí): Means "real, true, solid." Top: 宀 (mián, "roof") radical, bottom: 头 (tóu/"head" component) indicating substance or reality inside shelter.

**Examples**:  
- 请务必落实 (qǐng wùbì luòshí) - Please be sure to implement (this).  
- 这个政策已经落实了 (zhège zhèngcè yǐjīng luòshí le) - This policy has already been implemented.  
- 公司要落实安全措施 (gōngsī yào luòshí ānquán cuòshī) - The company must implement safety measures.

**Usage Notes**:  
落实 (luòshí) is most often used for abstract ideas like plans, policies, and responsibilities, not for physical objects. Used in both formal and semi-formal contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine 落 (luò) ("to fall") as ideas “falling” down to the 实 (shí) ("real, solid") level, turning plans into reality.
