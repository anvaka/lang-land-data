# **似乎 (sì hū) - Seems / Apparently / As if**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 似 (sì): Left: 亻(rén) "person" radical. Right: 以(yǐ), "to use/with/according to". Means "to resemble" or "like."  
- 乎 (hū): Top: 丶(zhǔ) "dot", Middle: 一(yī) "one", Bottom: 丿(piě) "slash", Bottom: 儿(ér) "child/legs". Means a modal particle; often used for "seems" or "like."

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 似乎 (sì hū) 不 喜欢 (bù xǐ huān) 这个 (zhè gè) 提议 (tí yì) 。(tā sì hū bù xǐ huān zhè gè tí yì.) - He seems not to like this proposal.  
- 天气 (tiān qì) 似乎 (sì hū) 要 变 (yào biàn) 坏 (huài) 了 (le) 。(tiān qì sì hū yào biàn huài le.) - The weather seems to be turning bad.

**Usage Notes**:  
似乎 (sì hū) is used to express uncertainty or inference, similar to "seems," "as if," or "apparently" in English. It usually appears before verbs or adjectives.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: 似 (sì) "resembles" + 乎 (hū) "an uncertain tone" = "seems as if."  
Picture a person (亻rén) imitating something, but you’re not sure-so it's only "seeming."
