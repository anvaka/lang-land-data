# **迷惑 (mí huò) - Confused; to puzzle, to baffle**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **迷** (mí): "to get lost, confused." Left: radical "辶" (chuò, walking movement); right: "米" (mǐ, rice). Suggests being lost in movement.  
- **惑** (huò): "to confuse, bewitch." Top: "或" (huò, perhaps, or) with meanings of possibility or uncertainty; bottom: "心" (xīn, heart), meaning the mind/heart is uncertain.

**Examples**:  
- 你的话让我很迷惑。(nǐ de huà ràng wǒ hěn mí huò.) - Your words confuse me.  
- 他迷惑地看着我。(tā mí huò de kàn zhe wǒ.) - He looked at me in confusion.  
- 这个问题让学生感到迷惑。(zhè gè wèn tí ràng xué shēng gǎn dào mí huò.) - This question made the students feel puzzled.

**Usage Notes**:  
**迷惑** (mí huò) can be a verb (to confuse) or adjective (confused). Often used for mental states, less commonly for physical confusion.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine your "heart" (**心** (xīn), at the bottom of **惑** (huò)) is "walking around lost" (**辶** (chuò), in **迷** (mí)). This is how it feels to be confused or **迷惑** (mí huò)!
