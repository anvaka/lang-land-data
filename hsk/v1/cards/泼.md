# **泼 (pō) - to splash, to throw (liquid), rude/harsh**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 泼 (pō):
  - Left: 氵(shuǐ) - "water" radical, indicates relation to liquid
  - Right: 发(fā) but written as 发 without the top stroke; here, it suggests "to send forth"
  - Combined, "sending forth water" = "to splash"

**Examples**:  
- 他(tā) 把(bǎ) 水(shuǐ) 泼(pō) 在(zài) 地上(dìshang)。 (Tā bǎ shuǐ pō zài dìshang.) - He splashed water on the ground.  
- 她(tā) 很(hěn) 泼辣(pōlà)。 (Tā hěn pōlà.) - She is very bold/forthright.  
- 不要(búyào) 往(wǎng) 别人(biérén) 身上(shēnshang) 泼水(pōshuǐ)。 (Búyào wǎng biérén shēnshang pōshuǐ.) - Don't splash water on others.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 泼(pō) is mainly used with liquids, but can describe unruly behavior (泼辣(pōlà): bold/fiery, often about women).  
- Often seen in verb-object phrases: 泼水(pōshuǐ) - to splash water.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine the three water drops 氵(shuǐ) on the left as droplets being "sent out" (right side 发(fā)), visualizing the act of splashing.
