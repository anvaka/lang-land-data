# **机遇 (jī yù) - Opportunity**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **机 (jī)**: Left = 木 (mù, "wood," radical for "tree/wood"); right = 几 (jī, "table" or "how many") on the top-right. Originally refers to a "machine" or "crucial moment".  
- **遇 (yù)**: Left = 辶 (chuò, "walk/movement," radical at the bottom-left); Right = 禺 (yú, "district/region") on the right. Means "to meet" or "encounter".

**Examples**:  
- 我们要把握机遇。(Wǒmen yào bǎwò jīyù.) - We must seize the opportunity.  
- 他因机遇而成功。(Tā yīn jīyù ér chénggōng.) - He succeeded because of an opportunity.  
- 每个人都有机遇。(Měi gè rén dōu yǒu jīyù.) - Everyone has opportunities.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **机遇 (jīyù)** is formal and often refers to rare, important chances, not everyday opportunities.  
- Compare with **机会 (jīhuì)**, which is more commonly used for "chance" or "opportunity" in daily conversation.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Picture a "machine (机 jī)" at the "right moment," helping you "meet (遇 yù)" good luck!  
- **机 (jī)**: Think of "timing" as the engine; **遇 (yù)**: movement towards a meeting.
