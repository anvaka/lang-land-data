# **舰艇 (jiàn tǐng) - Naval vessel; warship**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **舰** (jiàn): "Warship." Left: "舟" (zhōu, boat) radical; right: "见" (jiàn, to see), suggesting a ship seen/made for war.  
- **艇** (tǐng): "Boat" or "craft." Left: "舟" (zhōu, boat) radical; right: "廷" (tíng, court/hall), signaling a formal or specialized boat.

**Examples**:  
- 海军拥有许多现代化舰艇。(Hǎijūn yǒngyǒu xǔduō xiàndàihuà jiàntǐng.) - The navy has many modern vessels.  
- 这些舰艇正参加演习。(Zhèxiē jiàntǐng zhèng cānjiā yǎnxí.) - These warships are participating in an exercise.  
- 我们参观了军舰和其他舰艇。(Wǒmen cānguān le jūnjiàn hé qítā jiàntǐng.) - We toured a battleship and other naval vessels.

**Usage Notes**:  
"舰艇" (jiàntǐng) is a general term for navy vessels, often referring to military ships (vs. "船" (chuán) for civilian boats). Common in news, military contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
Both characters share the "舟" (zhōu, boat) radical on the left-think: all "舰艇" (jiàntǐng) are types of boats. Remember "舰" (jiàn) = warship, "艇" (tǐng) = boat/craft.
