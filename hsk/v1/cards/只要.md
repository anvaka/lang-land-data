# **只要 (zhǐyào) - as long as; only if**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **只 (zhǐ)**: "only," "just." Left-right structure: left is 口 (kǒu, mouth), right is 八 (bā, eight) positioned above 小 (xiǎo, small).  
- **要 (yào)**: "to want," "to need." Top-bottom structure: top is 西 (xī, west), bottom is 女 (nǚ, woman).

**Examples**:  
- 只要 (zhǐyào) 你 (nǐ) 努力 (nǔlì)，你 (nǐ) 就 (jiù) 会 (huì) 成功 (chénggōng)。(zhǐyào nǐ nǔlì, nǐ jiù huì chénggōng.) - As long as you work hard, you will succeed.  
- 他 (tā) 只要 (zhǐyào) 有 (yǒu) 钱 (qián)，就 (jiù) 开心 (kāixīn)。(tā zhǐyào yǒu qián, jiù kāixīn.) - He is happy as long as he has money.  
- 只要 (zhǐyào) 下雨 (xiàyǔ)，我 (wǒ) 就 (jiù) 不 (bù) 去 (qù)。(zhǐyào xiàyǔ, wǒ jiù bù qù.) - I won't go as long as it rains.

**Usage Notes**:  
只要 (zhǐyào) is used for expressing sufficient condition. It is usually paired with 就 (jiù) in the second clause.

**Memory Aids**:  
只 (zhǐ) = "only" and 要 (yào) = "need." So, 只要 (zhǐyào) reminds you: you "only need" this (condition) and something will happen.
