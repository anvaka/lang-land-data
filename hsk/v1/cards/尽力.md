# **尽力 (jǐn lì) - Do one's best; try one's best**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **尽 (jǐn)**: Left/right structure. Left is “⺁” (cliff, radical), right is “聿” (brush, meaning ‘finish/utmost’). Together: "to exhaust," "to use up."  
- **力 (lì)**: Single component. Represents an arm flexing (ancient picture), means "strength" or "effort."

**Examples**:  
- 我会尽力帮助你。(Wǒ huì jǐn lì bāng zhù nǐ.) - I will do my best to help you.  
- 他已经尽力了。(Tā yǐ jīng jǐn lì le.) - He has already tried his best.  
- 请尽力完成任务。(Qǐng jǐn lì wán chéng rèn wu.) - Please do your best to complete the task.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **尽力 (jǐn lì)** is a verb phrase, usually followed by another verb ("尽力做好", jǐn lì zuò hǎo - try one’s best to do well), or used independently for encouragement. Polite and common in daily conversation.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine using up (尽, jǐn) all your strength (力, lì): you **do your best** until no energy is left!
