# **盖 (gài) - cover; lid; to cover; to build**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 盖 (gài): Top is "十" (shí, ten), then "去" (qù, go), with "皿" (mǐn, dish) at the bottom. The components suggest "something over a container," fitting "cover" meaning.

**Examples**:  
- 请把盖子盖上。(Qǐng bǎ gàizi gài shàng.) - Please put the lid on.  
- 他盖了一座房子。(Tā gài le yī zuò fángzi.) - He built a house.  
- 雨水盖满了地。(Yǔshuǐ gài mǎn le dì.) - Rainwater covered the ground.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 盖 (gài) can be a verb ("to cover," "to build") or a noun (as in 盖子 gàizi, "lid").  
- Usually used in written and spoken contexts for physical covering or construction.

**Memory Aids**:  
Visualize "十" (shí) as a shield on top, with "皿" (mǐn) dish below-think of putting a lid over a dish.
