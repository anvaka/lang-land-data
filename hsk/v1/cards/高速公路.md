- 高 (gāo) - high; radical "高" (entire character is both the radical and base, suggesting height/loftiness)  
- 速 (sù) - fast; left: 辶 (chuò, walking movement), right: 束 (shù, bind/tie, here as phonetic)

**Usage Notes**:  
高速公路 (gāosù gōnglù) refers specifically to controlled-access roads for fast, long-distance travel, similar to "freeway" or "expressway" in English. It is usually used in formal/official contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: 高 (gāo, high) + 速 (sù, speed) = high-speed; 公 (gōng, public) + 路 (lù, road) = public road. So, 高速公路 (gāosù gōnglù): a public road for high-speed travel!
