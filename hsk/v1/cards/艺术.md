**Character Breakdown**:  
- 艺 (yì): "Art/skill." Left: 艹 (cǎo) radical (top), often related to grass/plants. Right: 云 (yún) (bottom), originally suggested "performance" or “moving.”  
- 术 (shù): "Technique/method." Left: 木 (mù) "wood/tree" (top), right: 朮 (zhú) (bottom), hinted at a plant with upright stem-later used for "method."

**Usage Notes**:  
艺术 (yìshù) covers all forms of art (like painting, music, dance). Often used as a noun. For an artist, say 艺术家 (yìshùjiā).

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine grass (艹 cǎo) growing above an act (云 yún): creativity blossoming above. 术 (shù) is like a tree: think “methods grow like branches”-art is skillful, methodical creation.
