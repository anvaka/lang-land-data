# **对联 (duìlián) - Couplet**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 对 (duì): "to face; pair." Left: 又 (yòu, "again/hand"). Right: 寸 (cùn, "inch"). Originally related to two things facing or matching.  
- 联 (lián): "to join; connect." Left: 耳 (ěr, "ear") as a radical. Right: 关 (guān, "to close/join"). Refers to linking together.

**Examples**:  
- 春节时，家家户户都会贴对联。(chūnjié shí, jiājiā hùhù dōu huì tiē duìlián) - Every household puts up couplets during Spring Festival.  
- 这副对联很有趣。(zhè fù duìlián hěn yǒuqù) - This pair of couplets is interesting.  
- 学生练习写对联。(xuéshēng liànxí xiě duìlián) - Students practice writing couplets.

**Usage Notes**:  
对联 (duìlián) are poetic, paired lines hung vertically, often on doorways during festivals like 春节 (chūnjié, Spring Festival). They follow strict patterns of tone and structure.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "对 (duì, pair)" + "联 (lián, connect)" = "paired lines connected together."  
Imagine two scrolls on each side of a doorway, always side by side as a perfect "pair connection."
