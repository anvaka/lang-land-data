# **句子 (jùzi) - Sentence**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 句 (jù): “Speech/phrase.” Left: 口 (kǒu, "mouth" radical, left side-relates to speaking). Right: 勹 (bāo, "wrap", right side-suggests enclosure).  
- 子 (zi): “Child/offspring.” Top: 一 (yī, "one" stroke). Bottom: 子 itself depicts a child with arms out.

**Examples**:  
- 这是一个句子。(Zhè shì yí gè jùzi.) - This is a sentence.  
- 请造一个句子。(Qǐng zào yí gè jùzi.) - Please make a sentence.  
- 句子要有主语和谓语。(Jùzi yào yǒu zhǔyǔ hé wèiyǔ.) - A sentence needs a subject and a predicate.

**Usage Notes**:  
句子 (jùzi) refers to a complete sentence, not just a phrase. Common in grammar lessons.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: 句 (jù, mouth + wrap) is "speech wrapped together," 子 (zi, child) makes it “a sentence is like a child of words.”
