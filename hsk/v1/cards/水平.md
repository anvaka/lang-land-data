# **水平 (shuǐpíng) - Level / Standard / Proficiency**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **水** (shuǐ): water. The major component is the "water" radical, which has droplets on the left and a flowing shape.  
- **平** (píng): flat, even. The upper part is "一" (yī, one) on top, indicating a flat surface; the lower part is "干" (gān, dry), which here means foundation/base.

**Examples**:  
- 他的汉语水平很高。(Tā de Hànyǔ shuǐpíng hěn gāo.) - His Chinese proficiency is very high.  
- 请问您的英语水平怎么样？(Qǐngwèn nín de Yīngyǔ shuǐpíng zěnmeyàng?) - May I ask how your English level is?  
- 这个比赛要求水平相同的选手参加。(Zhège bǐsài yāoqiú shuǐpíng xiāngtóng de xuǎnshǒu cānjiā.) - This competition requires participants of the same level.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **水平** (shuǐpíng) is often used to talk about skill or ability in languages, sports, or professional contexts.  
- Can also mean "horizontal" in physical descriptions.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine "水" (shuǐ, water) finding its "平" (píng, level) on a flat ("平") surface-just like liquids always seek their own level.
