# **十 (shí) - ten**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 十 (shí): Means "ten." The character shows two lines crossing (horizontal and vertical)-originally symbolizing "completeness" or "perfection." There are no radicals or enclosures; both strokes meet exactly at the middle.

**Examples**:  
- 我有十本书。(Wǒ yǒu shí běn shū.) - I have ten books.  
- 今天是十号。(Jīntiān shì shí hào.) - Today is the tenth (day).  
- 他十岁了。(Tā shí suì le.) - He is ten years old.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 十 (shí) is used for the number 10, in counting, dates, ages, and as a building block for higher numbers (e.g., 十一 (shí yī) = 11).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine 十 (shí) as a simple "plus" sign: 1 (vertical) + 0 (horizontal) = 10.  
- It looks like both hands (fingers spread) making a cross for "ten."
