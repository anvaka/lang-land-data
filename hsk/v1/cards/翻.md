# **翻 (fān) - to turn over, to flip**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 翻 (fān):
  - Radical: 羽 (yǔ, "feather") on top, symbolizing movement or flying.
  - Right: 番 (fān), which originally means "repetitions" or "times," hinting at repeated motion.

**Examples**:  
- 请翻(fān)开书。(Qǐng fān kāi shū.) - Please open (flip) the book.  
- 他翻(fān)了个身。(Tā fān le gè shēn.) - He turned over (his body).  
- 翻(fān)译很难。(Fān yì hěn nán.) - Translation is difficult.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 翻(fān) is used for physical turning (pages, bodies) and for actions like "translation" (翻译 fānyì).  
- Often followed by objects like 页(yè, page), 书(shū, book), or 身(shēn, body).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine flipping (翻 fān) a feather (羽 yǔ) in the air repeatedly (番 fān). The motion helps you remember "to flip" or "turn over."
