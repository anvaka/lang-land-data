# **正 (zhèng) - right, straight, just, correct**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **正** (zhèng): Top is "一" (yī) meaning "one;" bottom is "止" (zhǐ) meaning "stop." Combined, it suggests coming to a stop at the right place-hence, "correct/just/right."

**Examples**:  
- 现在正(zèng)在下雨。(Xiànzài zhèng(zèng) zài xiàyǔ.) - It's raining right now.  
- 他做得很正(zhèng)。(Tā zuò de hěn zhèng(zhèng).) - He did it very correctly.  
- 你的答案正(zhèng)确。(Nǐ de dá'àn zhèng(zhèng)què.) - Your answer is correct.

**Usage Notes**:  
- Often used before verbs for "in the process of" (e.g., 正(zhèng)在).  
- Adjective meaning "upright," "just," or "correct."  
- Opposite of 反(fǎn) ("opposite/wrong").

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a line (一, yī) at the top and a stop sign (止, zhǐ) at the bottom: stop at the right place = 正(zhèng); think "just right/precise."
