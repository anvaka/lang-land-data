# **正月 (zhēng yuè) - First month of the lunar year**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **正** (zhēng): "first", "upright", or "correct". Radical: 止 (zhǐ) "stop", on the bottom; above is 一 (yī) "one" on the top.  
- **月** (yuè): "moon" or "month". Radical: 月 (yuè) "moon", which is the entire character.

**Examples**:  
- 春节在正月初一。(Chūn jié zài zhēng yuè chū yī.) - The Spring Festival is on the first day of the first lunar month.  
- 正月是中国农历新年的开始。(Zhēng yuè shì Zhōngguó nónglì xīnnián de kāishǐ.) - The first lunar month is the start of the Chinese New Year.  
- 许多人喜欢在正月拜年。(Xǔ duō rén xǐhuān zài zhēng yuè bài nián.) - Many people like to pay New Year visits during the first lunar month.

**Usage Notes**:  
正月 (zhēng yuè) refers only to the first month in the lunar (not Gregorian) calendar. Commonly used in the context of traditional holidays.

**Memory Aids**:  
"正" (zhēng) means "first" or "start", so 正月 (zhēng yuè) is literally the "starting month". "正" (zhēng) stands tall and upright (like the start of the year), and "月" (yuè) is a crescent moon, reminding you it's about the lunar month.
