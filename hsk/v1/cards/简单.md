# **简单 (jiǎn dān) - simple / easy**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 简 (jiǎn): Left side is 竹 (zhú, "bamboo" radical) on top, indicating something related to writing materials (historically, bamboo slips). Right side is 间 (jiān, "space" or "between").  
- 单 (dān): Top is 单 (dān, "single" or "alone"), composed of 十 (shí, "ten") on top, with 曰 (yuē, "say") inside, and 又 (yòu, "again") at the bottom.

**Examples**:  
- 这个问题很简单。(Zhè ge wèntí hěn jiǎndān.) - This question is very simple.  
- 你能用简单的话说明吗？(Nǐ néng yòng jiǎndān de huà shuōmíng ma?) - Can you explain it in simple words?  
- 做饭其实很简单。(Zuò fàn qíshí hěn jiǎndān.) - Cooking is actually very easy.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 简单 (jiǎn dān) is commonly used to describe tasks, objects, or explanations as being easy or uncomplicated.  
- It works as both an adjective and adverb.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think: "Bamboo (简 jiǎn)" slips made things straightforward, and "single (单 dān)" means not complicated-together, simply simple!
