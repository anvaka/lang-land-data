# **地势 (dìshì) - terrain; topography**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 地 (dì): earth; ground. Left: 土 (tǔ, earth radical) represents "earth/soil." Right: 也 (yě) is a phonetic component.  
- 势 (shì): power; situation; force. Left: 扌 (shǒu, hand radical) means "hand." Right: 𠬶 (shì) supplies sound and additional meaning of "force" or "trend."

**Examples**:  
- 这里的地势很高。(Zhèlǐ de dìshì hěn gāo.) - The terrain here is very high.  
- 山区地势复杂。(Shānqū dìshì fùzá.) - The mountain area's topography is complicated.

**Usage Notes**:  
地势 (dìshì) is usually used to describe physical geography (mountains, plains, slopes), often in formal descriptions or reports.

**Memory Aids**:  
地 (dì) = ground; 势 (shì) = power/movement → "The *power* of the *earth* shapes the land" = terrain/topography.
