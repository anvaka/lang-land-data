# **秘密 (mì mì) - secret**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **秘** (mì): Left-“禾” (hé, grain, rice plant); right-“必” (bì, must/necessarily). Together: something "vital" hidden in "grain"-a sense of being concealed.  
- **密** (mì): Top-“宀” (mián, roof/radical for house); bottom-“必” (bì, must/necessarily) again. Under a "roof", something "must" be hidden-a meaning of secrecy/being covered.

**Examples**:  
- 这是我的秘密。(Zhè shì wǒ de mì mì.) - This is my secret.  
- 不要告诉别人这个秘密。(Bù yào gào sù bié rén zhè gè mì mì.) - Don’t tell others this secret.  
- 他有很多小秘密。(Tā yǒu hěn duō xiǎo mì mì.) - He has many little secrets.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **秘密** (mì mì) is a noun meaning "secret." Can be used to describe both abstract (ideas, information) and concrete (places, items) secrets.  
- Often appears with “保守” (bǎo shǒu, to keep) or “分享” (fēn xiǎng, to share).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a "grain" (**禾** hé) containing a "must" (**必** bì) hide something-**秘** (mì) = hidden.  
- Under a "roof" (**宀** mián), things are "necessarily" (**必** bì) kept inside-**密** (mì) = covered, close.  
- Two similar **mì** (mì) together = something important is doubly hidden = secret.
