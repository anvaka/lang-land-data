# **演员 (yǎn yuán) - Actor/Actress**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **演 (yǎn)**: "to perform; to act." Left: 氵(sān diǎn shuǐ, "water" radical), right: 寅 (yín, meaning "perform" here). The water radical often relates to movement or flow.  
- **员 (yuán)**: "person; member." Top: 口 (kǒu, "mouth"), inside: 贝 (bèi, "shell/money" in old script), together indicating a person in a group or role.

**Examples**:  
- 她是一名优秀的演员。(Tā shì yī míng yōuxiù de yǎnyuán.) - She is an excellent actor.  
- 这部电影有很多有名的演员。(Zhè bù diànyǐng yǒu hěn duō yǒumíng de yǎnyuán.) - This movie has many famous actors.  
- 他想成为一名演员。(Tā xiǎng chéngwéi yī míng yǎnyuán.) - He wants to become an actor.

**Usage Notes**:  
演员 (yǎnyuán) is gender-neutral. Use 明星 (míngxīng, "star") if emphasizing fame. Commonly used for both theater and film.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 演 (yǎn, "perform") as "water" (氵) flowing through the stage, and 员 (yuán, "member") as a person (口) in a group-an actor is someone who performs as part of a troupe!
