# **批发 (pīfā) - wholesale**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **批 (pī)**: Left side is 手 (shǒu, "hand") radical; right side is 比 (bǐ, "compare"). Originally related to movements of the hand (gestures, making comments), now used for "batch" or "to approve."  
- **发 (fā)**: Left side is 又 (yòu, "again/hand"); right side is a simplified component. Means "to send out," "to issue," or "to develop."

**Examples**:  
- 我们只做批发 (wǒmen zhǐ zuò pīfā) - We only do wholesale.  
- 这家商店批发鞋子 (zhè jiā shāngdiàn pīfā xiézi) - This shop wholesales shoes.  
- 批发价格更低 (pīfā jiàgé gèng dī) - Wholesale prices are lower.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **批发 (pīfā)** is a business term; opposite of 零售 (língshòu, "retail"). Used for goods sold in large quantities.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine "批 (pī)" as "a batch" and "发 (fā)" as "to send out"-so 批发 (pīfā) = "to send out in batches" (i.e., wholesale).
