# **占线 (zhàn xiàn) - Line is busy (phone line is occupied)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **占** (zhàn): Left/right structure. Left is "卜" (bǔ) meaning "divine", right is "口" (kǒu) meaning "mouth". Means "to occupy" or "to take up."  
- **线** (xiàn): Top/bottom structure. Top is "纟" (sī), the silk radical, indicating relation to threads; bottom is "戋" (jiān), often relates to "smallness" or "fine." Means "line, thread, wire."

**Examples**:  
- 电话占线 (diàn huà zhàn xiàn) - The phone is busy.  
- 我一直打，可是电话占线。 (wǒ yì zhí dǎ, kě shì diàn huà zhàn xiàn.) - I kept calling, but the line was busy.  
- 请稍等，线路占线中。 (qǐng shāo děng, xiàn lù zhàn xiàn zhōng.) - Please wait, the line is currently busy.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **占线** (zhàn xiàn) is commonly used when referring to busy telephone lines.  
- Usually appears after a phone call attempt or as a message on a screen/phone.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine "占" (zhàn) "occupying" the "线" (xiàn, line) so no signal can get through-someone is already on the line!
