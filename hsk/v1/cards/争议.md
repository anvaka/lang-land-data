**Character Breakdown**:  
- **争 (zhēng)**: Means "to dispute, fight, contend." Top: 亠 (tóu, lid radical), suggests cover; bottom: 爪 (zhǎo, claw) and 又 (yòu, again/hand). The components together evoke the act of struggling or contending.  
- **议 (yì)**: Means "discussion, opinion." Left: 讠(yán, speech radical) indicates relation to speaking; right: 义 (yì, justice/righteousness), suggesting speaking about justice or opinions.

**Usage Notes**:

**Memory Aids**:  
争 (zhēng): Imagine two claws under a roof fighting for space-争 (zhēng) means to contend.  
议 (yì): Speech (讠yán) plus righteousness (义yì): discussing what is right-议 (yì) means discussion.
