# **平坦 (píng tǎn) - Level; flat; smooth**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 平 (píng): Flat, level. The radical 八 (bā, "eight") is on top, suggesting division or spreading, over the character 干 (gān, "dry" or "shield") on the bottom.  
- 坦 (tǎn): Smooth, level. The left is 土 (tǔ, "earth/soil"), relating to land, and the right is 旦 (dàn, "dawn, daybreak"), with 日 (rì, "sun") above 一 (yī, "one"): new day over earth.

**Examples**:  
- 这条路很平坦。(Zhè tiáo lù hěn píngtǎn.) - This road is very flat.  
- 草原十分平坦。(Cǎoyuán shífēn píngtǎn.) - The grassland is extremely level.  
- 平坦的道路容易行走。(Píngtǎn de dàolù róngyì xíngzǒu.) - Flat roads are easy to walk on.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 平坦 (píngtǎn) is mostly used for surfaces like roads, land, or terrain. It can also be figuratively for situations or progress.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine 平 (píng) as a surface with nothing sticking up (flat), and 坦 (tǎn) as "earth" (土 tǔ) at "dawn" (旦 dàn) - the land looks smooth and even in the morning light.
