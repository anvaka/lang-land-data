# **展开 (zhǎn kāi) - to unfold; to expand**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **展 (zhǎn)**: means "to spread out," "exhibit."
  - Radical: 尸 (shī) on the top, which originally means "corpse" or "body," often appears in characters related to movement or posture.
  - Bottom part: 廿 (niàn), means "twenty," but here acts as a phonetic element.  
- **开 (kāi)**: means "to open."
  - Left: 一 (yī) at the top ("one"),
  - Middle: 廾 (gǒng) at the bottom ("two hands"), often seen in characters about opening or holding.

**Examples**:  
- 请把地图展开。(Qǐng bǎ dìtú zhǎn kāi.) - Please unfold the map.  
- 讨论会将在明天展开。(Tǎolùn huì jiāng zài míngtiān zhǎn kāi.) - The discussion will start tomorrow.  
- 他的计划已经展开了。(Tā de jìhuà yǐjīng zhǎn kāi le.) - His plan has already begun to expand.

**Usage Notes**:  
展开 (zhǎn kāi) can refer to physical unfolding (like a paper or a fan) or abstract expansion (like ideas, plans, movements). Usually used as a verb.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine 展 (zhǎn) as spreading something out with hands (bottom part 廾 (gǒng)), while 开 (kāi) means "open"―so together: "spread open" or "unfold."
