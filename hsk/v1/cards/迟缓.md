# **迟缓 (chí huǎn) - Slow; sluggish**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **迟 (chí)**: “辶 (chuò)” walk/movement radical on the left, “尸 (shī)” corpse on the right; originally means "late."  
- **缓 (huǎn)**: “纟 (sī)” silk radical on the left, “爰 (yuán)” on the right (meaning to pull or prolong); together, indicates "slowing down" or "gentle."

**Examples**:  
- 行动迟缓 (xíng dòng chí huǎn) - Actions are sluggish.  
- 反应迟缓 (fǎn yìng chí huǎn) - Response is slow.  
- 他的思维很迟缓 (tā de sī wéi hěn chí huǎn) - His thinking is very slow.

**Usage Notes**:  
迟缓 (chí huǎn) is often used to describe reactions, actions, progress, or thinking that is not quick. It's somewhat formal and often appears in written or medical contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
迟 (chí) looks like a person delayed on their path (辶 (chuò)), and 缓 (huǎn) is like threads (纟 (sī)) being gently pulled-both suggest slowing down.
