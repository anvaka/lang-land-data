- 她还(hái)没来。(Tā hái méi lái.) - She hasn't come yet.  
- 请还(huán)我书。(Qǐng huán wǒ shū.) - Please return my book.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 还(hái): Means "still," "also," or "yet." Used for continuing actions or adding info.  
- 还(huán): Means "to return (something)." Different pinyin and meaning; depends on context.

**Memory Aids**:  
- The 辶(chuò) radical implies moving or returning; think "walking back" to remember "return."  
- "还(hái)" often shows something is ongoing, like you're "still" on the journey.
