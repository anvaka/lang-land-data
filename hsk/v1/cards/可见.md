# **可见 (kějiàn) - it is clear; obviously; it shows that**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **可** (kě): "can; may." On top is the "mouth" radical 口 (kǒu), representing speaking or ability, with the "top hat" component as the uppermost part.  
- **见** (jiàn): "see; to perceive." On left is "person" radical (亻, rén), right is a simplified "eye" shape.

**Examples**:  
- 天气这么冷，**可见**(kějiàn)冬天来了。(Tiānqì zhème lěng, kějiàn dōngtiān lái le.) - The weather is so cold, it shows that winter has come.  
- 他从不迟到，**可见**(kějiàn)他很守时。(Tā cóng bù chídào, kějiàn tā hěn shǒushí.) - He is never late, obviously he is very punctual.  
- 路上很湿，**可见**(kějiàn)刚才下过雨。(Lùshàng hěn shī, kějiàn gāngcái xiàguò yǔ.) - The road is very wet, so it’s clear it rained just now.

**Usage Notes**:  
**可见**(kějiàn) is usually in the beginning or middle of sentences, connecting evidence to a conclusion. Similar to "so" or "thus" in English.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "可**(kě)**" (can) + "见**(jiàn)**" (see) = "can be seen" ⇒ "obviously; it shows." If you **can see** something, it is obvious!
