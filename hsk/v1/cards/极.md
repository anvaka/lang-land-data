# **极 (jí) - extreme; utmost; extremely**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 极 (jí): Left is 木 (mù, "wood"), right is 及 (jí, "to reach"); together, implies "to reach the limit," like reaching the tip of a branch.

**Examples**:  
- 天气极好。(Tiānqì jí hǎo.) - The weather is excellent.  
- 我极喜欢这本书。(Wǒ jí xǐhuan zhè běn shū.) - I extremely like this book.  
- 他跑得极快。(Tā pǎo de jí kuài.) - He runs extremely fast.

**Usage Notes**:  
极 (jí) is often placed before or after adjectives/adverbs for emphasis, similar to "extremely" in English, but is usually used in written/literary Chinese.

**Memory Aids**:  
Picture "wood" (木 mù) growing until it "reaches" (及 jí) its limit-this is 极 (jí): the utmost point!
