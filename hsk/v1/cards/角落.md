# **角落 (jiǎoluò) - Corner**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **角 (jiǎo)**: "corner" or "horn." Top: "⺮" (jiǎo) radical meaning bamboo/angle, bottom: "用" (yòng) meaning to use. The full character suggests a shape or angle.  
- **落 (luò)**: "place" or "to fall." Top: "艹" (cǎo, grass) radical, middle: "乐" (lè, happy), bottom: "水" (shuǐ, water) component (as dots). Together hints at something landing/located.

**Examples**:  
- 小猫 (xiǎomāo) 躲在 (duǒzài) 角落 (jiǎoluò) 里 (lǐ)。 (The kitten is hiding in the corner.)  
- 他 (tā) 坐在 (zuòzài) 房间 (fángjiān) 的 (de) 角落 (jiǎoluò)。 (He sits in a corner of the room.)  
- 在 (zài) 每个 (měi gè) 角落 (jiǎoluò)，都有 (dōu yǒu) 灯光 (dēngguāng)。 (There is light in every corner.)

**Usage Notes**:  
角落 (jiǎoluò) means a physical or metaphorical corner, often referring to a hidden or quiet place. It typically takes the location particle 里 (lǐ, inside).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 角 (jiǎo, corner) as the angle and 落 (luò, place) as the spot where something "lands"-so 角落 (jiǎoluò) is where an angle "lands," i.e., the corner!
