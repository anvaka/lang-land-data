# **角度 (jiǎodù) - Angle; Point of View**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 角 (jiǎo): "Horn; angle" - Radical: 角 (jiǎo, "horn") at the top; resembles a horn, which has an "angle" or point.  
- 度 (dù): "Degree; measure" - Radical: 广 (yǎn, "shelter") top-left, and 又 (yòu, "again/hand") at the bottom-right; relates to measuring or a degree (of an angle, temperature, etc.).

**Examples**:  
- 请从另一个角度(jiǎodù)看问题。(Qǐng cóng lìng yí gè jiǎodù kàn wèntí.) - Please look at the issue from another angle/point of view.  
- 这个角度(jiǎodù)很难拍照。(Zhège jiǎodù hěn nán pāizhào.) - This angle is hard to photograph.  
- 他用科学的角度(jiǎodù)解释了这个现象。(Tā yòng kēxué de jiǎodù jiěshì le zhège xiànxiàng.) - He explained this phenomenon from a scientific perspective.

**Usage Notes**:  
角度(jiǎodù) can be used for both physical angles (in math, geometry, photography, etc.) and metaphorically for "point of view" or "perspective" in discussions.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 角(jiǎo, horn) as something that sticks out at an angle, and 度(dù, degree) is a "measurement"-so 角度(jiǎodù) measures an angle or viewpoint.
