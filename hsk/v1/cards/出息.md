# **出息 (chūxi) - Future prospects; promise; success**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **出** (chū) - To go out, emerge. Formed with two "mountain" 山 (shān) radicals: one on top and one on bottom, suggesting something coming out from between mountains.  
- **息** (xī) - Breath, rest. Top is "self" 自 (zì), representing the nose (for breathing); bottom is "heart" 心 (xīn), referring to feeling or rest.

**Examples**:  
- 他(tā)很(hěn)有(yǒu)出息(chūxi)。 (tā hěn yǒu chūxi.) - He has great promise.  
- 别(bié)做(zuò)个(ge)没(méi)出息(chūxi)的人(rén)。 (bié zuò ge méi chūxi de rén.) - Don’t be someone without prospects.  
- 她(tā)希望(xīwàng)儿子(érzi)有(yǒu)出息(chūxi)。 (tā xīwàng érzi yǒu chūxi.) - She hopes her son will succeed.

**Usage Notes**:  
出息(chūxi) is mostly used to express someone's future achievements, often in a personal or professional sense-sometimes humorously or critically.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine "coming out" (出 chū) to "breathe" (息 xī) fresh air as you reach success; success is like emerging from the mountains to take a deep breath of new opportunities.
