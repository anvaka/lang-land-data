# **晚上 (wǎnshang) - evening; night**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 晚 (wǎn): "evening, late." Left side is 日 (rì) "sun" (left), right side is 免 (miǎn) "to avoid" (right). The sun sets, transitioning to evening.  
- 上 (shang): "above, up." Represents something being above or on top.

**Examples**:  
- 我晚上(wǒ wǎnshang)去(qù)跑步(pǎobù)。 (wǒ wǎnshang qù pǎobù) - I go running in the evening.  
- 晚上(wǎnshang)好(hǎo)！ (wǎnshang hǎo) - Good evening!  
- 你晚上(nǐ wǎnshang)吃(chī)了(le)吗(ma)？ (nǐ wǎnshang chī le ma) - Did you eat tonight?

**Usage Notes**:  
晚上(wǎnshang) is often used for the time after sunset until midnight. Place it before/after the subject for time context.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 晚(wǎn) as the "sun (日 rì) saying goodbye (免 miǎn)"-it's getting late. 上(shang) adds a sense of period or time "above" the day, marking evening.
