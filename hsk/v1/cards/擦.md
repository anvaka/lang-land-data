# **擦 (cā) - to wipe; to rub**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 擦 (cā): Left side is 扌 (shǒu, "hand" radical, indicates action by hand); right side is 察 (chá, "to examine")-on top, 宀 (mián, "roof"), middle 祭 (jì, "to sacrifice"). The right conveys meaning/pronunciation.

**Examples**:

**Usage Notes**:  
擦 (cā) is most common for "to wipe/clean" with effort using a cloth or tissue. Not used for washing (that’s 洗 xǐ).

**Memory Aids**:  
扌 (shǒu, hand) + 察 (chá, examine)-imagine closely examining and wiping a surface with your hand.
