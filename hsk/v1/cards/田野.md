**Character Breakdown**:  
- 田 (tián): Field; paddies. Resembles a plot of farmland, with the radical 囗 (wéi) enclosing cross lines like furrows and boundaries.  
- 野 (yě): Wild; open country. Left is 里 (lǐ, "village" or "inside"), right is 予 (yǔ, "give"), together it implies a place outside of settlement (the "wild" beyond the village).

**Usage Notes**:  
田野( tián yě) usually refers to rural, open country or expansive farmlands, often in nature-related or poetic contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
田 (tián) looks like a field with four plots. 野 (yě) sounds like "yeah!"-imagine shouting "yeah!" while running wild in open fields.
