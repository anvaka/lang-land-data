# **拼音 (pīn yīn) - Pinyin (Chinese phonetic alphabet)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 拼 (pīn): "to piece together, to spell." Left: 扌(shǒu, "hand" radical), right: 并 (bìng, "combine"). Suggests putting parts together.  
- 音 (yīn): "sound." Top: 立 (lì, "stand"), bottom/inside: 日 (rì, "sun"). Historically linked to the idea of a sound or music.

**Examples**:  
- 你会拼音吗？(nǐ huì pīn yīn ma?) - Do you know Pinyin?  
- 请用拼音写出这个词。(qǐng yòng pīn yīn xiě chū zhè gè cí.) - Please write this word in Pinyin.  
- 她的拼音很好。(tā de pīn yīn hěn hǎo.) - Her Pinyin is very good.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 拼音 (pīn yīn) is widely used to teach pronunciation and help type Chinese on keyboards.  
- Always lowercase in romanization unless at the start of a sentence.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 拼 (pīn): Imagine "hands" (扌, shǒu) putting pieces together ("combine").  
- 音 (yīn): “Sound” rises like the "sun" (日, rì) standing tall (立, lì).  
- 拼音 (pīn yīn): "Spell the sounds" - assembling ("拼", pīn) the "sounds" ("音", yīn) of words.
