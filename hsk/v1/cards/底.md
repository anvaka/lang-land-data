# **底 (dǐ) - bottom; base; end**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 底 (dǐ):
  - Top: 广 (guǎng) "shelter/house" radical, indicating a roof or covering.
  - Bottom: 氐 (dī) component, which means "foundation" and provides the phonetic cue.
  - Together, conveys the "base" or "bottom" of a structure.

**Examples**:  
- 他(tā)在(zài)箱子(xiāngzi)底(dǐ)下(xià)找(zhǎo)到了(dàole)钥匙(yàoshi)。 (Tā zài xiāngzi dǐ xià zhǎo dào le yàoshi.) - He found the key at the bottom of the box.  
- 水(shuǐ)底(dǐ)有(yǒu)很多(hěn duō)石头(shítou)。 (Shuǐ dǐ yǒu hěn duō shítou.) - There are many stones at the bottom of the water.  
- 年(nián)底(dǐ)我们(wǒmen)会(huì)放假(fàngjià)。 (Nián dǐ wǒmen huì fàngjià.) - We'll have a holiday at the end of the year.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 底(dǐ) is used for the lowest part of something or metaphorically for the "end" (e.g., 年底(nián dǐ) = end of year).  
- Often combined with 下(xià) ("under": 底下(dǐxià)) or specific nouns.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think of 广(guǎng) (roof) covering a foundation (氐(dī))-the bottom/base of a building.  
- "Dǐ" sounds like "deep," reminding you it's the bottom or deepest part.
