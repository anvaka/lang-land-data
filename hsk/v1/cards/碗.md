   - Left: 石 (shí) "stone" radical, indicating it’s often made of ceramic or stone, positioned on the left.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think of the "石" (shí) "stone" (left) as the material, and "宛" (wǎn) (right) as the container-a graceful (宛) stone (石) makes a "碗" (wǎn) (bowl).  
- "Wǎn" sounds like "want"-you "want" a bowl to eat!
