# **恰巧 (qiàqiǎo) - Just by chance; coincidentally**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 恰 (qià): Left is 忄(xīn) "heart" radical, right is 合(hé) "combine"-suggesting something fitting the heart, meaning "just right."  
- 巧 (qiǎo): Left is 工(gōng) "work," right is 丂(qiǎo) phonetic component-suggests "skillful" or "by chance."

**Examples**:  
- 我(wǒ) 恰巧(qiàqiǎo) 经过(jīngguò) 你(nǐ) 家(jiā)。 (Wǒ qiàqiǎo jīngguò nǐ jiā.) - I happened to pass by your house.  
- 恰巧(qiàqiǎo) 遇到(yùdào) 老师(lǎoshī)。 (Qiàqiǎo yùdào lǎoshī.) - I coincidentally ran into the teacher.  
- 他(tā) 恰巧(qiàqiǎo) 有(yǒu) 空(kòng)。 (Tā qiàqiǎo yǒu kòng.) - He just happens to be free.

**Usage Notes**:  
Mostly used in positive, neutral, or surprising situations to describe an unexpected coincidence. Often appears at the beginning or before the verb.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "The heart (忄xīn) feels just right (恰qià) when things skillfully (巧qiǎo) fall into place-by coincidence!"
