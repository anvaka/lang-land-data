# **其实 (qí shí) - actually; in fact**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **其 (qí)**: Means “its, his, her, their,” or refers to something/someone previously mentioned. Radical: 八 (bā, "eight") on top, followed by 乂 (yì) in the middle, and a horizontal stroke at the bottom.  
- **实 (shí)**: Means “real, true.” Radical: 宀 (mián, "roof") at the top, followed by 头 (tóu, “head”) inside.

**Examples**:  
- 其实(qí shí)我(wǒ)不(bù)知道(zhī dào)。 (qí shí wǒ bù zhī dào.) - Actually, I don’t know.  
- 你(nǐ)其实(qí shí)很(hěn)聪明(cōng ming)。 (nǐ qí shí hěn cōng ming.) - You’re actually very smart.  
- 其实(qí shí)他(tā)已经(yǐ jīng)来了(lái le)。 (qí shí tā yǐ jīng lái le.) - In fact, he has already come.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 其实(qí shí) usually appears at the start or middle of a sentence to introduce a clarification, correction, or real situation.  
- Used in both spoken and written Chinese for emphasis.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 其(qí): Imagine a "hat" (八(bā), top) on something mysterious (the unknown underneath).  
- 实(shí): “Truth” is protected under a “roof” (宀(mián)).  
- Remember: “Actually (其实(qí shí)),” the “truth (实(shí))” is “underneath (其(qí))” what you see.
