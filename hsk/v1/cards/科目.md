# **科目 (kē mù) - Subject (school subject, topic)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **科 (kē)**: Left side is 禾 (hé, "grain," plant radical), right side is 斗 (dǒu, "ladle" or "measure"); together often relates to division or branches of study/science.  
- **目 (mù)**: Means "eye"; upper part is horizontal lines (eyelashes), bottom part is the main eye shape.

**Examples**:  
- 我最喜欢的科目是数学。(Wǒ zuì xǐhuan de kēmù shì shùxué.) - My favorite subject is math.  
- 你有多少门科目？(Nǐ yǒu duōshǎo mén kēmù?) - How many subjects do you have?  
- 英语是必修科目。(Yīngyǔ shì bìxiū kēmù.) - English is a required subject.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 科目 (kēmù) is mostly used for academic/school subjects, not for "themes" or "matters."  
- Often paired with 门 (mén, "measure word") as in 一门科目 (yì mén kēmù) - one subject.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Picture 科 (kē, "science/branch") as organizing grains (禾/hé) into categories; 目 (mù, "eye") helps you "see" the list of subjects.  
- 科目 (kēmù): "Branches you study with your eyes."
