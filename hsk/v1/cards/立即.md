**Usage Notes**:  
- 立即 (lì jí) is formal and often used in written Chinese, official contexts, or giving commands.  
- Synonyms: 马上 (mǎ shàng), 立刻 (lì kè), but 立即 (lì jí) is less colloquial.

**Memory Aids**:  
- “立 (lì)” is “stand”; when you stand (“立 (lì)”) and act at the very instant (“即 (jí)”), you do it immediately!  
- Imagine someone springing up (立 (lì)) and acting right then (即 (jí)).
