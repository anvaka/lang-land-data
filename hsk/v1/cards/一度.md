# **一度 (yī dù) - Once; at one time**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 一 (yī): "One." Single horizontal stroke, represents the number 1; simplest numeral.  
- 度 (dù): "Degree; time; occasion." Left: 广 (yǎn) radical (top/left), means building or shelter. Right: 又 (yòu) component (bottom/right), means "again." "Degree" or "occasion," as in times or temperature.

**Examples**:  
- 我一度 (wǒ yī dù) 怀疑 (huái yí) 他 (tā)。 (Wǒ yī dù huái yí tā.) - I once doubted him.  
- 这里的 (zhè lǐ de) 天气 (tiān qì) 一度 (yī dù) 变冷 (biàn lěng)。 (Zhè lǐ de tiān qì yī dù biàn lěng.) - The weather here once turned cold.  
- 他一度 (tā yī dù) 想放弃 (xiǎng fàng qì)。 (Tā yī dù xiǎng fàng qì.) - He once wanted to give up.

**Usage Notes**:  
一度 (yī dù) often implies "for a period in the past," not just a one-time occurrence. Used in both spoken and written Chinese, usually to describe an earlier stage or temporary state.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think "one (一 yī) time (度 dù)." Picture a thermometer from the past for "degree/time."
