**Character Breakdown**:  
- **提** (tí): “to lift; to raise.” Left: 扌 (shǒu) "hand" radical; right: 是 (shì) "is/yes" as the phonetic part. The hand radical on the left suggests action with the hand, like lifting.  
- **高** (gāo): “high; tall.” Top: a roof-like shape; bottom: 口 (kǒu) "mouth" inside. Depicts a tall building with a window.

- Used for both abstract (skills, standards) and concrete improvements.

**Memory Aids**:  
- **提** (tí): Picture a “hand” holding “something” to lift it up-raising.  
- **高** (gāo): Think of a “tall” building with a “window/mouth” (口, kǒu) inside-high up!
