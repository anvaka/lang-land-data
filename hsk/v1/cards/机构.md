# **机构 (jīgòu) - Organization; Institution; Mechanism**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **机 (jī)**:
  - Left: 木 (mù, "wood") radical - represents material/component.
  - Right: 几 (jī, "table/desk") - phonetic component.
  - Meaning: machine, engine, opportunity.  
- **构 (gòu)**:
  - Left: 木 (mù, "wood") radical - base/material.
  - Right: 勾 (gōu, "hook") - phonetic, suggests assembling.
  - Meaning: to construct, to form.

**Examples**:  
- 这个 (zhège) 机构 (jīgòu) 很大。 (hěn dà.) - This organization is large.  
- 教育 (jiàoyù) 机构 (jīgòu) 提供 (tígōng) 服务 (fúwù)。 - Educational institutions provide services.  
- 你 (nǐ) 属于 (shǔyú) 哪个 (nǎge) 机构 (jīgòu)？ - Which organization do you belong to?

**Usage Notes**:  
- 机构 (jīgòu) refers to formal organizations, institutions, or internal structural units.  
- Used for both abstract (system, structure) and concrete (company, government office) meanings.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Both characters have 木 (mù, wood), so think "wooden parts" assembled to make a structure-an institution is many parts working together.
