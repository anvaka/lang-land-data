# **流露 (liú lù) - To reveal; to show unconsciously**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **流 (liú)**: "To flow." Left: 氵(shuǐ) "water" radical; Right: 㐬 (liú) "stream, flow." Related to movement of water.  
- **露 (lù)**: "To show; dew." Top: 雨 (yǔ) "rain;" Bottom: 路 (lù) "road" without the left foot radical. Implies something exposed after rain.

**Examples**:  
- 他的脸上流露 (liú lù) 出惊讶。(Tā de liǎn shàng liú lù chū jīngyà.) - Surprise showed on his face.  
- 她不常流露 (liú lù) 情感。(Tā bù cháng liú lù qínggǎn.) - She doesn't often show her feelings.  
- 孩子们流露 (liú lù) 出真实的快乐。(Háizimen liú lù chū zhēnshí de kuàilè.) - The children displayed genuine happiness.

**Usage Notes**:  
流露 (liú lù) often describes feelings or thoughts unintentionally revealed through facial expressions, words, or actions. Used for abstract things (emotions, intentions), not physical objects.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine emotions "flowing" (流 liú) out and becoming "exposed" (露 lù) like dew after rain - you can’t hide what flows and shows.
