# **餐厅 (cān tīng) - Restaurant / Dining hall**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **餐 (cān)**: Means "meal" or "food". Left: "食 (shí)" radical (food, at the top); right: 𠂉 (gōng) and 又 (yòu), phonetic component.  
- **厅 (tīng)**: Means "hall" or "room". Left: "厂 (chǎng)" radical (cliff, at the left); right: 丁 (dīng) (individual, at the right).

**Usage Notes**:  
餐厅 (cāntīng) is used for restaurants, cafeterias, or any dining places. Context determines formality; for formal "restaurant," one might also see 饭店 (fàndiàn).

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine 餐 (cān) as containing the food radical (hint: "eat"), and 厅 (tīng) as a spacious "hall" to eat in-a place where meals are served.
