# **凝视 (níng shì) - To gaze/stare fixedly**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 凝 (níng): On the left, 冫(bīng, "ice" radical) suggests stillness/cold; on the right, 疑 (yí, "doubt/suspect"), here provides sound. As a whole, means "to congeal" or "to fix (one’s attention)."  
- 视 (shì): On the left, 见 (jiàn, "see") denotes “to look”; on the right, 示 (shì, "to show") is phonetic. Together, means "to look at" or "to view."

**Examples**:  
- 她 (tā) 凝视 (níng shì) 着 (zhe) 窗外 (chuāng wài)。 (Tā níng shì zhe chuāng wài.) - She gazed out the window.  
- 他 (tā) 长时间 (cháng shí jiān) 凝视 (níng shì) 着 (zhe) 电脑屏幕 (diàn nǎo píng mù)。 (Tā cháng shí jiān níng shì zhe diàn nǎo píng mù.) - He stared at the computer screen for a long time.  
- 小猫 (xiǎo māo) 凝视 (níng shì) 着 (zhe) 飞鸟 (fēi niǎo)。 (Xiǎo māo níng shì zhe fēi niǎo.) - The kitten stared at the bird.

**Usage Notes**:  
凝视 (níng shì) implies focus and intensity, often silent and emotional. Usually used with 着 (zhe) for ongoing action.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine your eyes "freeze" (凝, níng) on something as you "view" (视, shì) it-just like staring at a painting in a museum.
