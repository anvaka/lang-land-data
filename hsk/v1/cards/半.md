# **半 (bàn) - half**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 半 (bàn): “Half” or “semi-.”
  - Radical: 十 (shí) “ten” on the top.
  - Below: Two horizontal lines with a vertical hook on the right.
  - The structure represents “dividing ten into two halves.”

**Examples**:  
- 我只有半个苹果。(Wǒ zhǐ yǒu bàn gè píngguǒ.) - I only have half an apple.  
- 现在是七点半。(Xiànzài shì qī diǎn bàn.) - It’s half past seven.  
- 半个月后我们见面。(Bàn gè yuè hòu wǒmen jiànmiàn.) - We'll meet in half a month.

**Usage Notes**:  
半 (bàn) is used before measure words or as a suffix to indicate "half," as in 半小时 (bàn xiǎoshí, half an hour) or 七点半 (qī diǎn bàn, 7:30). Not used as “half of someone” (for that, use 一半 (yí bàn)).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of dividing 十 (shí, ten) in half to get 半 (bàn, half). The shape of the character looks like something split into two parts!
