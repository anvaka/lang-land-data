# **尾巴 (wěi ba) - tail**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **尾** (wěi): "tail." Radical **尸** (shī, "corpse") on top, suggesting body parts, with **毛** (máo, "hair") at the bottom, often relating to fur or body hair.  
- **巴** (ba): "suffix" here. Shape resembles an open mouth; used mainly as a noun suffix or diminutive ending.

**Examples**:  
- 小猫有一条长尾巴。(Xiǎo māo yǒu yì tiáo cháng wěi ba.) - The kitten has a long tail.  
- 狗摇着尾巴。(Gǒu yáo zhe wěi ba.) - The dog is wagging its tail.  
- 别踩到蛇的尾巴。(Bié cǎi dào shé de wěi ba.) - Don’t step on the snake’s tail.

**Usage Notes**:  
**尾巴** (wěi ba) is mainly used for animals’ tails or things resembling tails (e.g., comet tails). The **-巴** (ba) makes it a casual noun.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: **尾** (wěi, tail) + **巴** (ba, soft suffix) = "tail-bar" or something attached at the end. For **尾** (wěi), imagine a furry (毛 máo) body part (尸 shī) at the rear!
