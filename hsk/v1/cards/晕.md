# **晕 (yūn) - dizzy; to faint**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **晕** (yūn): The left side is 日 (rì, "sun") on top, representing sunlight. The right side is 军 (jūn, "army") spanning top (冖 mìm, "cover") and bottom (车 chē, "vehicle"), forming part of the phonetic component. Overall, it combines the idea of "light" and "disorientation."

**Examples**:  
- 我( wǒ )头( tóu )晕( yūn )了( le )。 (Wǒ tóu yūn le.) - I feel dizzy.  
- 他( tā )晕( yūn )倒( dǎo )在( zài )地( dì )上( shàng )。 (Tā yūn dǎo zài dì shàng.) - He fainted to the ground.  
- 你( nǐ )晕( yūn )车( chē )吗( ma )？(Nǐ yūn chē ma?) - Do you get carsick?

**Usage Notes**:  
- 晕(yūn) can mean "dizzy," "to faint," or "to feel sick," often due to motion (晕车 yūnchē, carsick; 晕船 yūnchuán, seasick).  
- Used as a verb or adjective.

**Memory Aids**:  
- The sun 日(rì) on top makes your head spin under the strong light; think of feeling dizzy after standing in the sun too long.
