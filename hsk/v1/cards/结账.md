# **结账 (jié zhàng) - Settle the bill / Check out**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **结 (jié)**: means "to tie; to knot; to conclude." The left side is 纟(sī, "silk," radical for thread) and right side 吉(jí, "auspicious"), suggesting tying things up.  
- **账 (zhàng)**: means "account; bill." Left side is 贝(bèi, "shell," ancient currency) and right side is 长(cháng, "long"), indicating something long related to money.

**Examples**:  
- 请结账。(Qǐng jié zhàng.) - Please settle the bill.  
- 我们要结账了。(Wǒmen yào jié zhàng le.) - We want to pay the bill.  
- 可以刷卡结账吗？(Kěyǐ shuā kǎ jié zhàng ma?) - Can I pay by card?

**Usage Notes**:  
结账(jié zhàng) is commonly used in restaurants, hotels, and shops. It means asking for the total bill and to pay. Can be used as both a verb and noun phrase.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 结(jié) as "tying up" and 账(zhàng) as "accounts"-so 结账(jié zhàng) is "tying up accounts," or settling payments.
