# **方言 (fāngyán) - Dialect**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **方** (fāng): "direction, region." The top is a slanted dot; the bottom is a right-angled box. Radical: 方 (fāng) itself, often means "square" or "region."  
- **言** (yán): "speech, words." Top: horizontal stroke (一 yī); middle: "口" (kǒu, "mouth" radical) inside; bottom: flowing lines indicating speech.

**Examples**:  
- 中国有很多方言。(Zhōngguó yǒu hěn duō fāngyán.) - China has many dialects.  
- 他说的是上海方言。(Tā shuō de shì Shànghǎi fāngyán.) - He is speaking the Shanghai dialect.  
- 你能听懂多少种方言？(Nǐ néng tīng dǒng duōshǎo zhǒng fāngyán?) - How many dialects can you understand?

**Usage Notes**:  
- **方言** (fāngyán) refers to regional languages within a country, especially non-standard local forms.  
- Used when talking about language differences within the same larger cultural or geographic area (like within China).

**Memory Aids**:  
- **方** (fāng): Picture a "region" or "square" on a map-each might have its own way of speaking.  
- **言** (yán): Looks like a mouth sending out words-think "speech."  
- Together, "regional speech" = dialect!
