# **逢 (féng) - to meet; to come upon**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 逢 (féng):
  - Left: 辶 (chuò) "walk" radical, indicates movement.
  - Right: 夆 (féng), phonetic, contains 丰 (fēng) "abundant" on top and 大 (dà) "big" at the bottom.

**Examples**:  
- 久别重逢 (jiǔ bié chóng féng) - to meet again after a long separation  
- 每逢周末 (měi féng zhōu mò) - every weekend  
- 遇逢困难 (yù féng kùn nán) - to encounter difficulties

**Usage Notes**:  
- 逢 (féng) is often used in formal or literary contexts to mean "to meet" or "whenever (something happens)" (e.g., 每逢 (měi féng) = every time). Not for casual "meeting friends" (use 见 (jiàn)).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think of 逢 (féng) as "walking (辶 (chuò))" and "abundantly (丰 (fēng))" "meeting (大 (dà))" someone on the road.
