# **有 (yǒu) - to have; there is/are**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 有 (yǒu): Left side is the radical 月 (yuè), originally meaning "flesh" or "moon" (here, "meat/flesh"); right side is 又 (yòu), which means "again" or "hand." Together, it suggests "to possess" or "to hold something in the hand."

**Examples**:  
- 我有书。(Wǒ yǒu shū.) - I have a book.  
- 他有很多朋友。(Tā yǒu hěn duō péngyǒu.) - He has many friends.  
- 桌子上有一只猫。(Zhuōzi shàng yǒu yì zhī māo.) - There is a cat on the table.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 有 (yǒu) is both a verb ("to have") and an existential verb ("there is/are").  
- To make negative, use 没有 (méiyǒu): 我没有钱。(Wǒ méiyǒu qián.) - I don't have money.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Picture a hand (又 yòu) holding a piece of meat (月 yuè): If you "have" meat in your hand, you possess something!
