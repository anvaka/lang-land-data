**Character Breakdown**:  
- **推** (tuī): "to push."
  - Left: 手(扌) (shǒu) - "hand" radical.

- **测** (cè): "to measure; to survey."
  - Left: 氵(shuǐ) - "water" radical.
  - Right: 则 (zé) - "rule; standard," itself made of 贝(bèi) "shell/money" bottom, 刂(dāo) "knife" right.

**Examples**:  
- 我们只能推测(tuīcè)他的想法。(Wǒmen zhǐ néng tuīcè tā de xiǎngfǎ.) - We can only speculate about his thoughts.

**Memory Aids**:  
- **推**(tuī): Use your "hand" to "push" (move) towards an answer.  
- **测**(cè): "Water" (氵shuǐ) helps you "measure" (like depth)-so you push to measure, i.e., infer.
