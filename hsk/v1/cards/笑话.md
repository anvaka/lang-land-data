# **笑话 (xiàohuà) - joke; to joke, a joke**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **笑** (xiào): means "to laugh" or "smile." The radical ⺮(zhú) is on top (bamboo, as in ancient comedy props), and 夭 (yāo, lively) is at the bottom.  
- **话** (huà): means "words" or "speech." The radical 讠(yán, speech) is on the left, and 舌 (shé, tongue) is on the right.

**Examples**:  
- 你听过这个笑话吗？(Nǐ tīngguò zhège xiàohuà ma?) - Have you heard this joke before?  
- 他喜欢讲笑话。(Tā xǐhuān jiǎng xiàohuà.) - He likes to tell jokes.  
- 她的笑话很好笑。(Tā de xiàohuà hěn hǎoxiào.) - Her jokes are very funny.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **笑话** (xiàohuà) is both a noun ("a joke") and a verb ("to mock/laugh at").  
- As a verb: "不要笑话别人。" (Bùyào xiàohuà biérén.) - "Don't make fun of others."

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: **笑** (xiào) = "laugh" + **话** (huà) = "words" → "words that make you laugh" = joke!
