# **引擎 (yǐn qíng) - Engine**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **引** (yǐn): means "to pull" or "to lead." The left side is the "弓" (gōng, bow) radical and the right is "丨" (gǔn, a straight line) suggesting pulling a bowstring.  
- **擎** (qíng): means "to lift" or "to hold up." The left is the "扌" (shǒu, hand) radical, and the right is "𢦏" (jīng), which conveys support or raising.

**Examples**:  
- 这辆车的引擎(yǐn qíng)很强大。(Zhè liàng chē de yǐn qíng hěn qiáng dà.) - The engine of this car is very powerful.  
- 飞机的引擎(yǐn qíng)出现了故障。(Fēi jī de yǐn qíng chū xiàn le gù zhàng.) - The airplane's engine had a malfunction.  
- 引擎(yǐn qíng)启动了。(Yǐn qíng qǐ dòng le.) - The engine has started.

**Usage Notes**:  
引擎(yǐn qíng) mainly refers to mechanical or computer "engines," e.g., car engines or search engines (搜索引擎 sōu suǒ yǐn qíng).

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine 引(yǐn, pull) as pulling energy, and 擎(qíng, lift) as lifting or powering. Together, they power and "pull" your vehicle forward, like an engine does!
