- **约** (yuē): "to make an appointment; approximately." Left: 纟(sī, "silk" radical), right: 勺(sháo, "spoon").  
- **会** (huì): "to meet; meeting." Top: 人(rén, "person" component); bottom: 云(yún, "cloud"), indicating coming together like people gathering under a cloud.

**Usage Notes**:

Think of tying (纟, silk) a string (**约** (yuē)) to remind someone about meeting in the clouds (**会** (huì)), like making plans for a special get-together.
