- **司 (sī)**: Means "to take charge of" or "manage". Top: “一 (yī)” (one). Middle: “口 (kǒu)” (mouth). Bottom: “㠯 (yǐ)” (archaic tool). The "mouth" in the middle hints at giving orders.  
- **令 (lìng)**: Means "command" or "order". Top: “亠 (tóu)” (lid). Middle: “人 (rén)” (person). Bottom: “卩 (jié)” (seal). Picture a person under a roof receiving commands.

**Memory Aids**:  
司 (sī) = "mouth" controlling; 令 (lìng) = "person" under "roof" being given an "order". Imagine a boss with a loud voice (mouth) giving commands (order) from above (roof).
