# **的 (de) - (possessive/modifying particle; "of", "-'s")**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 的 (de): Left side is 白 (bái - white), right side is 勺 (sháo - spoon). Combining these, originally used in classical texts; now a particle.

**Examples**:  
- 我的书 (wǒ de shū) - My book  
- 她的猫 (tā de māo) - Her cat  
- 新的手机 (xīn de shǒu jī) - New cellphone

**Usage Notes**:  
- 的 (de) links two nouns to show possession or attributes (A 的 (de) B = B of A, or A's B).  
- Very common in written and spoken Chinese.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine 白 (bái) as a blank label and 勺 (sháo) as the tool you use to "tag" ownership. 的 (de) attaches a property to a noun, just like tagging it.
