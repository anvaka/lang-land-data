# **生肖 (shēngxiào) - Chinese Zodiac**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 生 (shēng): Means "life" or "to be born." Composed of a top horizontal stroke and vertical lines, symbolizing sprouting or growth from the earth (the bottom).  
- 肖 (xiào): Means "resemble" or "image." Left side is 月 (yuè) "moon"/"flesh"; right side is 小 (xiǎo) "small," symbolizing something resembling a small likeness.

**Examples**:  
- 你属什么生肖？(Nǐ shǔ shénme shēngxiào?) - What is your zodiac animal?  
- 我的生肖是兔。(Wǒ de shēngxiào shì tù.) - My zodiac is the rabbit.  
- 生肖有十二种动物。(Shēngxiào yǒu shí'èr zhǒng dòngwù.) - There are twelve animals in the zodiac.

**Usage Notes**:  
生肖 (shēngxiào) refers to the 12-animal cycle used for years, zodiac signs, and personality traits in Chinese culture. Used with 属 (shǔ) to ask "Which zodiac are you?"

**Memory Aids**:  
Think 生 (shēng) = birth/life (people born), 肖 (xiào) = resemble (they "resemble" an animal). So, 生肖 (shēngxiào): "the animal you resemble at birth."
