# **眼睛 (yǎn jīng) - eyes**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 眼 (yǎn): Left side is 目 (mù, "eye" radical), right side is 艮 (gèn, represents "stopping" or "looking").  
- 睛 (jīng): Left side is 目 (mù, "eye" radical), right side is 青 (qīng, "blue/green") indicating brightness or clarity.

**Examples**:  
- 我的眼睛很大。(Wǒ de yǎn jīng hěn dà.) - My eyes are big.  
- 他的眼睛很漂亮。(Tā de yǎn jīng hěn piàoliang.) - His eyes are beautiful.  
- 你眼睛累了吗？(Nǐ yǎn jīng lèi le ma?) - Are your eyes tired?

**Usage Notes**:  
- 眼睛 (yǎn jīng) is always used in the plural sense ("eyes"), not for a single eye (that would be 眼 (yǎn)).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Both 眼 (yǎn) and 睛 (jīng) have the eye radical 目 (mù) on the left-think of two eyes side by side.  
- 睛 (jīng) sounds like "jing," similar to "jingle"-your eyes sparkle and shine like jingling bells.
