# **机器 (jīqì) - machine**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **机 (jī)**: Left = 木 (mù, wood, left), right = 几 (jī, table/chair, right). Originally means device or mechanism related to wood (ancient machines).  
- **器 (qì)**: Top/middle = 口 (kǒu, mouth, four times), bottom = 大 (dà, big), together meaning tool, device, or utensil.

**Examples**:  
- 这台机器 (zhè tái jīqì) 很贵 (hěn guì)。- This machine is expensive.  
- 工厂有很多机器 (gōngchǎng yǒu hěn duō jīqì)。- The factory has many machines.  
- 我的手机也是一种机器 (wǒ de shǒujī yě shì yī zhǒng jīqì)。- My cellphone is also a kind of machine.

**Usage Notes**:  
**机器 (jīqì)** is a general term for "machines". Used for mechanical devices, especially not living things. For "machinery" as a collective term, use **机械 (jīxiè)**.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of **机 (jī)** as mechanical (wood and device), and **器 (qì)** as tools (four mouths + big). So, **机器 (jīqì)** = "mechanical tool" = machine.
