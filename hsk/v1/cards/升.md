# **升 (shēng) - to rise; to ascend; measure for volume (liter)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 升 (shēng): The top "丿" (piě) and "一" (yī) resemble an upward stroke and horizon, suggesting upward movement; below, "廾" (gǒng) means “two hands,” representing lifting something up.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 升 (shēng) is both a verb ("to rise", "to promote") and a measure word (1 升 (shēng) ≈ 1 liter).
