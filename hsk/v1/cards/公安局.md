# **公安局 (gōng'ān jú) - Public Security Bureau (Police Station)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 公 (gōng): "public." Top: 八 (bā, "eight"-here a variant), bottom: 厶 (sī, "private"-suggests contrast to private).  
- 安 (ān): "peace, safe." Top: 宀 (mián, "roof"), bottom: 女 (nǚ, "woman")-historically, a woman under a roof brings peace.  
- 局 (jú): "bureau, office." Left: 尸 (shī, representing a "house"), right: 句 (jù, "sentence/phrase").

**Examples**:  
- 我去公安局 (wǒ qù gōng'ān jú) - I am going to the police station.  
- 你在公安局工作吗？(nǐ zài gōng'ān jú gōngzuò ma?) - Do you work at the Public Security Bureau?  
- 公安局处理此案 (gōng'ān jú chǔlǐ cǐ àn) - The Public Security Bureau is handling this case.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 公安局 (gōng'ān jú) is the official term for "police station" or "police bureau" in China. Used in both spoken and written contexts, often formal.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine 安 (ān) as "safety under a roof," and 局 (jú) as the "official office." 公 (gōng) plus 安 (ān) = public safety. So, 公安局 (gōng'ān jú) is where public safety is managed!
