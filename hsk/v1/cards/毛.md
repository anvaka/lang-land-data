# **毛 (máo) - hair; fur; 0.1 yuan (informal)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **毛** (máo): Means “hair” or “fur.” Composed of the radical **毡** (zhān, felt) on the top and a couple of strokes underneath. Top strokes resemble stray strands of hair.

**Examples**:  
- 这只猫的毛很长。(Zhè zhī māo de máo hěn cháng.) - This cat's fur is very long.  
- 我有一毛钱。(Wǒ yǒu yī máo qián.) - I have one (10-cent) coin.  
- 这根毛是谁的？(Zhè gēn máo shì shuí de?) - Whose hair is this?

**Usage Notes**:  
- **毛** (máo) means both animal and human hair (not on the head), or fur.  
- Informally, **毛** (máo) is used for "0.1 yuan" in spoken Chinese.  
- Not used for scalp hair (that’s **头发** (tóu fa)).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine the character’s top strokes as scattered **hair** (máo) or **fur** (máo).  
- For money, think: "A dime is just a little ‘hair’ of a yuan."
