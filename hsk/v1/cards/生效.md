# **生效 (shēngxiào) - To take effect; to become effective**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 生 (shēng): "to give birth," "to arise," or "to produce." The top is a "grass" radical, the bottom part depicts growth or new life.  
- 效 (xiào): "effect" or "result." The left is 攵 (pū, "to strike"), the right is 交 (jiāo, "to intersect"), suggesting action leads to outcome.

**Examples**:  
- 新政策明天生效。(Xīn zhèngcè míngtiān shēngxiào.) - The new policy takes effect tomorrow.  
- 这个合同下周生效。(Zhège hétóng xià zhōu shēngxiào.) - This contract becomes effective next week.  
- 合同签署后立即生效。(Hétóng qiānshǔ hòu lìjí shēngxiào.) - After the contract is signed, it becomes effective immediately.

**Usage Notes**:  
生效 (shēngxiào) is often used in legal, business, or formal contexts, especially about laws, policies, contracts, or agreements becoming valid or starting to apply.

**Memory Aids**:  
生 (shēng, "to give life") + 效 (xiào, "effect/result"): When something is "given life" (生 shēng), it starts to "have an effect" (效 xiào)!
