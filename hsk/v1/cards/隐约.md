# **隐约 (yǐn yuē) - faint; indistinct; vague**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 隐 (yǐn): On the left, "阝"(fù) radical means "mound" or "hill"; on the right, "急"(jí) (without the heart component) means "urgent/tight." Combined, suggests something hidden or not obvious.  
- 约 (yuē): On the left, "纟"(sī) radical (silk) refers to thread/connection; on the right, "勺"(sháo) means "ladle." 约 (yuē) means "to make an appointment," "to restrain," or "approximate/vague."

**Examples**:  
- 她(ta)的(de)声音(shēng yīn)隐约(yǐn yuē)传来(chuán lái)。- Her voice faintly drifted over.  
- 我(wǒ)隐约(yǐn yuē)记得(jì de)那(nà)天(tiān)的(de)情景(qíng jǐng)。- I vaguely remember that day’s scene.  
- 灯光(dēng guāng)隐约(yǐn yuē)可见(kě jiàn)。- The light is faintly visible.

**Usage Notes**:  
隐约 (yǐn yuē) is often used for things perceived dimly or unclearly (sounds, lights, memories, feelings). Usually as an adverb or adjective.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine 隐(yǐn) as something "hidden on the side of a hill," and 约(yuē) as a "thread holding things together lightly (not tightly bound)," making the sense of "not clear, faint."
