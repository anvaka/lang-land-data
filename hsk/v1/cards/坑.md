# **坑 (kēng) - Pit; Hole; Trap**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 坑 (kēng):
  - Left: 土 (tǔ, "earth" radical, suggests relation to ground or soil)

- 别被他坑了。(Bié bèi tā kēng le.) - Don’t get tricked by him.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 坑 (kēng) is both a physical "hole/pit" and used metaphorically for "trap" or "to deceive."  
- In slang, "被坑" (bèi kēng) = "get ripped off" or "get tricked."

**Memory Aids**:

- 亢 (kàng) at the right: Sounds like kēng.  
- Imagine a "pit (坑, kēng)" dug in the soil (土, tǔ).
