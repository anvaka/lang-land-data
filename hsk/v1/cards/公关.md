- 公 (gōng): "Public" or "common." Top: 八 (bā), meaning "eight" or "division." Bottom: 厶 (sī), a private/secret component; together, represents something that is not private, hence “public.”  
- 关 (guān): "Relation" or "connection." Left: 门 (mén), "door" radical. Inside: 关 (guān) as phonetic, suggesting “to close” or “relation.”
