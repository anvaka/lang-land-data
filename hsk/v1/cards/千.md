# **千 (qiān) - thousand**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 千 (qiān): Means "thousand." The top stroke is a short horizontal line (一 yī) representing "one," and the bottom part is like 十 (shí, "ten"). The combination suggests "ten hundreds"-a thousand.

**Examples**:  
- 我有一千元。(Wǒ yǒu yī qiān yuán.) - I have one thousand yuan.  
- 千山万水 (qiān shān wàn shuǐ) - thousands of mountains and rivers (vast distance)  
- 有千种方法。(Yǒu qiān zhǒng fāngfǎ.) - There are a thousand ways.

**Usage Notes**:  
千 (qiān) is used for numbers (1,000) and idiomatically for "many." It is often combined with 万 (wàn, ten thousand) in set phrases.

**Memory Aids**:  
Picture the character as "ten (十 shí) times one hundred," hinting at 1,000. Remember “千 (qiān)” sounds a bit like “kilo-” (1,000 in English metric words).
