# **号 (hào) - number; date; mark; size**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 号 (hào): The left side is 口 (kǒu, mouth), and the right side is 丂 (kǎo, breath or sound). Historically, it relates to making a sound (to announce), which then extended to meaning "number/sign."

**Examples**:  
- 今天是五月五号。(Jīntiān shì wǔ yuè wǔ hào.) - Today is May 5th.  
- 我的电话号码是1234567。(Wǒ de diànhuà hàomǎ shì yī èr sān sì wǔ liù qī.) - My phone number is 1234567.  
- 你穿多大号的鞋？(Nǐ chuān duō dà hào de xié?) - What shoe size do you wear?

**Usage Notes**:  
- 号 (hào) is commonly used for dates, identification numbers, apartment or room numbers, and sizes (clothing, shoes).  
- When reading dates: 月 (yuè) + 日/号 (rì/hào). In spoken Chinese, 号 (hào) is preferred over 日 (rì).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine announcing people’s numbers out loud, using your 口 (kǒu, mouth) to call a “号 (hào, number).”  
- 号 (hào) looks like a mouth plus something being said-easy to recall its "label" or "number" meaning.
