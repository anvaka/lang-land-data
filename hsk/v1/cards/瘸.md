# **瘸 (qué) - Lame; Limping**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 瘸 (qué): Left side is 疒 (nè, "sickness" radical, left side), right side is 拓 (tuò, here as phonetic, right side). The 疒 radical signals illness or a bodily condition.

**Examples**:  
- 他的腿瘸了。(Tā de tuǐ qué le.) - His leg is lame.  
- 她走路一瘸一拐的。(Tā zǒulù yì qué yì guǎi de.) - She walks with a limp.  
- 那只狗瘸着走。(Nà zhī gǒu qué zhe zǒu.) - That dog is walking with a limp.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 瘸 (qué) is usually used for legs or when someone/something walks abnormally due to injury or disorder.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 瘸 (qué): The 疒 (nè, sickness radical on the left) reminds you it's health-related; the “拓” (tuò, right side) looks a bit like twisted legs. Imagine someone’s leg has a "twist" and is sick-so they limp.
