# **滋味 (zī wèi) - Taste; Flavor; Feeling**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **滋** (zī): On the left is "氵" (shuǐ, water radical) signifying liquid, on the right is "兹" (zī, meaning "now"/"to increase"); together suggests something moist or juicy.  
- **味** (wèi): On top is "口" (kǒu, mouth radical), below is "未" (wèi, not yet); originally refers to the taste sensed in the mouth.

**Examples**:  
- 这种水果的**滋味**(zī wèi)很特别。(Zhè zhǒng shuǐguǒ de zī wèi hěn tèbié.) - The taste of this fruit is very unique.  
- 生活有苦有甜，各有**滋味**(zī wèi)。(Shēnghuó yǒu kǔ yǒu tián, gè yǒu zī wèi.) - Life has its ups and downs, each with its own flavor.  
- 他忘不了这个胜利的**滋味**(zī wèi)。 (Tā wàng bùliǎo zhège shènglì de zī wèi.) - He can't forget the taste of this victory.

**Usage Notes**:  
**滋味**(zī wèi) can refer to literal (taste of food) or figurative (emotional experience) flavors. Often paired with adjectives like 甜(tián, sweet), 苦(kǔ, bitter), or used in expressions about life and feelings.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think "滋**zī**" (liquid, increase) + "味**wèi**" (mouth, taste) = "the flavor sensed by your mouth, especially from something moist." To remember the figurative sense, recall: experiences always leave a "**taste**(wèi)" in life-sometimes sweet, sometimes bitter.
