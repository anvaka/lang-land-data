# **铃 (líng) - bell; small bell**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **铃 (líng)**
  - Left: 钅(jīn) "metal" radical (indicates metal/material),
  - Right: 令 (lìng), serves as phonetic component; originally means “command/order”.

**Examples**:  
- 门铃响了。(Ménlíng xiǎng le.) - The doorbell rang.  
- 我喜欢那串风铃。(Wǒ xǐhuān nà chuàn fēnglíng.) - I like that string of wind chimes.  
- 铃声很清脆。(Língshēng hěn qīngcuì.) - The bell sound is very crisp.

**Usage Notes**:  
**铃 (líng)** often appears in compound words like **门铃 (ménlíng)** (doorbell), **风铃 (fēnglíng)** (wind chime), **铃声 (língshēng)** (bell ringing). Used mostly for small or handheld bells.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of **铃 (líng)** combining "metal (钅jīn)" + "command (令 lìng)": bells made of metal that command attention when rung.
