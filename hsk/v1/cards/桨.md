# **桨 (jiǎng) - Oar; Paddle**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 桨 (jiǎng): The left side is 木 (mù) "wood" radical (left), indicating it's an object made from wood. The right side is the phonetic component 将 (jiāng/jiàng) (right), suggesting pronunciation.

**Examples**:  
- 他用桨(jiǎng)划船。(Tā yòng jiǎng huáchuán.) - He rows the boat with an oar.  
- 我们各拿一只桨(jiǎng)。(Wǒmen gè ná yī zhī jiǎng.) - Each of us holds an oar.  
- 没有桨(jiǎng), 船漂不动。(Méiyǒu jiǎng, chuán piāo bù dòng.) - Without an oar, the boat can't move.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 桨(jiǎng) is mainly used for traditional rowboats or canoes; often appears in 水上运动 (shuǐ shàng yùn dòng, water sports) contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
- The 木(mù, wood) radical reminds you it's made of wood; think "桨(jiǎng) is the tool that 'joins' you to the water." The sound is similar to English "join," helping recall pronunciation.
