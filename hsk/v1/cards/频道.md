# **频道 (píndào) - channel (TV/radio/YouTube)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **频** (pín): "frequency", left side is **页** (yè, page/head), right is **乒** (pīng, from 'ping pong'), suggesting repetition or frequency.  
- **道** (dào): "path/way", left is **辶** (chuò, walk/move, as a trailing stroke at the bottom), right is **首** (shǒu, head/top), together meaning pathway.

**Examples**:  
- 请换到体育频道。(Qǐng huàn dào tǐyù píndào.) - Please switch to the sports channel.  
- 你订阅了哪些YouTube频道？(Nǐ dìngyuè le nǎxiē YouTube píndào?) - Which YouTube channels have you subscribed to?  
- 这个频道每天播放新闻。(Zhège píndào měitiān bòfàng xīnwén.) - This channel broadcasts news every day.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **频道** (píndào) is mainly used for TV, radio, or video site channels.  
- For communication channels (wireless, frequency), **频道** (píndào) is also correct.  
- Do not use **频道** (píndào) for small chat groups; say **群** (qún, group) instead.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think of **频** (pín) as "frequent" signals and **道** (dào) as a "path" = a path for frequent signals = "channel."
