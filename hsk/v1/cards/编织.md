# **编织 (biān zhī) - to weave, to knit**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **编 (biān)**:
  - Left: 纟(sī, "silk" radical), relates to textiles.
  - Right: 扁(biǎn), meaning "flat"-suggests making something flat with silk threads.  
- **织 (zhī)**:
  - Left: 纟(sī, "silk" radical), again related to threads/textiles.
  - Right: 戠(zhí), ancient form for "to manage/arrange," suggesting threads being arranged.

**Examples**:  
- 她正用毛线编织 (tā zhèng yòng máoxiàn biānzhī) - She is knitting with yarn.  
- 这个篮子是用竹子编织的 (zhège lánzi shì yòng zhúzi biānzhī de) - This basket is woven from bamboo.  
- 我们一起编织梦想 (wǒmen yīqǐ biānzhī mèngxiǎng) - We weave (create) dreams together.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 编织 (biānzhī) is used for making fabric, nets, baskets, or metaphorically for creating something abstract (e.g., dreams, stories).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Both characters use the "silk" radical, so think of threads coming together ("编 (biān)") and being arranged ("织 (zhī)") into something new.  
- Imagine hands (扁(biǎn), 戠(zhí)) weaving threads.
