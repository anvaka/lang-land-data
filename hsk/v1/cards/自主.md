# **自主 (zìzhǔ) - independent; autonomy**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **自 (zì)**: means "self." Top: strokes resembling a nose (from its origin), as "nose" is a classical metaphor for oneself.  
- **主 (zhǔ)**: means "main" or "master." Top: dot representing flame/light. Bottom: vertical stroke and cross meaning "lord" or someone in control.

**Examples**:  
- 他很自主。(Tā hěn zìzhǔ.) - He is very independent.  
- 学生要学会自主学习。(Xuéshēng yào xuéhuì zìzhǔ xuéxí.) - Students should learn to study independently.  
- 我们支持民族自主。(Wǒmen zhīchí mínzú zìzhǔ.) - We support national autonomy.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **自主 (zìzhǔ)** is often used for people or groups making choices on their own, without external control. Common in formal or academic contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
- **自 (zì)** = "self" (think: point to your nose-yourself!).  
- **主 (zhǔ)** = "master" (the dot is a lamp, master lights the way).  
- **自主 (zìzhǔ)**: "Self-master" → master of oneself = independent.
