**Usage Notes**:  
- 顿时 (dùnshí) is mainly used in written Chinese to show that something happened at that very instant, often as the result of a sudden change. It usually refers to the *past*, not future.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think of 顿 (dùn) as "stop" (pause for an instant) and 时 (shí) as "moment in time"; so 顿时 (dùnshí) = "at the same moment, instantly".  
- Remember: 顿 (dùn) (food radical) → a "sudden meal" you get right away!
