# **得 (dé / de / děi) - to get; structural particle; must**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 得 (dé / de / děi):
  - Left: 彳(chì) - "step" or "walk," suggests movement/action.
  - Right-top: 日(rì) - "sun," component often relates to brightness or time.
  - Right-bottom: 寸(cùn) - "inch," can imply small amount or measurement.
  - Together, originally meant to "obtain by walking/measuring."

**Examples**:  
- 我得去工作。(Wǒ děi qù gōngzuò.) - I must go to work.  
- 他说得很好。(Tā shuō de hěn hǎo.) - He speaks very well.  
- 你得到了什么？(Nǐ dé dào le shénme?) - What did you get?

**Usage Notes**:  
- 得(de) as a structural particle links verbs to complements: verb + 得 + result/degree.  
- 得(děi) means "must" or "have to."  
- 得(dé) means "to get/obtain."  
- Tone changes meaning; pay attention!

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think: You "walk" (彳chì) in the "sun" (日rì) for an "inch" (寸cùn) and "get" (得dé) what you want.  
- The particle 得(de) always follows a verb (e.g., 做得好 zuò de hǎo).  
- 得(děi) sounds like "day," so you must do it today!
