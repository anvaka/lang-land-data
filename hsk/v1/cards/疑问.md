# **疑问 (yí wèn) - Question; Doubt**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **疑 (yí)**: "To doubt"; Left side is "疒 (nè)" meaning "sickness" + right top "矛 (máo, spear)" and right bottom "匕 (bǐ, dagger-axe)". Suggests inner conflict or questioning.  
- **问 (wèn)**: "To ask"; Left "门 (mén, door)" surrounds right "口 (kǒu, mouth)". Literally, "mouth at the door" = someone asking questions.

**Examples**:  
- 你有任何疑问吗？(nǐ yǒu rènhé yíwèn ma?) - Do you have any questions?  
- 他的回答没有解决我的疑问。(tā de huídá méiyǒu jiějué wǒ de yíwèn.) - His answer didn't solve my doubt.  
- 如果有疑问，请举手。(rúguǒ yǒu yíwèn, qǐng jǔshǒu.) - If you have questions, please raise your hand.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **疑问 (yíwèn)** is used for questions, doubts, or uncertainties.  
- Often appears as **有疑问 (yǒu yíwèn)** (have a question/doubt).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a "sick (疒 nè)" mind fighting with "weapons (矛 máo/匕 bǐ)" = inner doubt (**疑 yí**).  
- Think of someone at your "door (门 mén)" with a "mouth (口 kǒu)"-ready to ask (**问 wèn**)!
