# **零星 (língxīng) - scattered; sporadic; fragmentary**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **零** (líng): Means "zero"; "rain" (雨 yǔ) on top, "orders" (令 lìng) below. Refers to fractional or leftover parts.  
- **星** (xīng): Means "star"; "sun" radical (日 rì) on left, "birth" (生 shēng) on right.

**Examples**:  
- 天空中有零星的星星。(Tiānkōng zhōng yǒu língxīng de xīngxing.) - There are a few scattered stars in the sky.  
- 我只记得一些零星的细节。(Wǒ zhǐ jìde yìxiē língxīng de xìjié.) - I only remember some fragmented details.  
- 下了几场零星小雨。(Xiàle jǐ chǎng língxīng xiǎoyǔ.) - There were a few sporadic light showers.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **零星** (língxīng) is often used to describe things that are not continuous or complete, e.g., **零星时间** (língxīng shíjiān)-"bits of free time."

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine "零" (líng) as small drops (zeroes) and "星" (xīng) as stars: "scattered like a few stars (零星) in the sky."
