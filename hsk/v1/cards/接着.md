# **接着 (jiēzhe) - to continue; next; then**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **接** (jiē): "to receive; to catch; to connect." Left: 扌(shǒu), "hand" radical indicates an action; right: 妾(qiè), related to "to take."  
- **着** (zhe): "to keep on; to continue." Top: 羊(yáng), "sheep"; bottom: 目(mù), "eye." Here often serves as a grammatical particle indicating continuation.

**Examples**:  
- 请你接着说。(Qǐng nǐ jiēzhe shuō.) - Please continue speaking.  
- 他接着做作业。(Tā jiēzhe zuò zuòyè.) - He continued doing homework.  
- 我们吃完饭接着看电影。(Wǒmen chī wán fàn jiēzhe kàn diànyǐng.) - After eating, we will watch a movie next.

**Usage Notes**:  
**接着** (jiēzhe) connects actions, meaning "then" or "continue to." Often at the start or middle of sentences. Not to be confused with **继续** (jìxù), which means "to persist" and is more formal.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine your "hand" (**手** shǒu in **接** jiē) "catching" (**接** jiē) the "next" thing. The particle **着** (zhe) shows the action keeps going-so "接着" (jiēzhe): "catch and keep going."
