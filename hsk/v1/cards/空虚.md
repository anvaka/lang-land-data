# **空虚 (kōng xū) - Emptiness, Hollow**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **空** (kōng): "Empty," "sky." Top: 穴 (xué, "cave/roof"), bottom: 工 (gōng, "work/craft"). Together: an empty space or cave.  
- **虚** (xū): "Void," "false," "unreal." Left: 虍 (hū, "tiger stripes," top-left), right: 云 (yún, "cloud," right/inside) - the sense of something insubstantial, like clouds or illusions.

**Examples**:  
- 他的心里感到很空虚。(tā de xīn lǐ gǎn dào hěn kōng xū.) - He feels very empty inside.  
- 成功后，她依然觉得空虚。(chéng gōng hòu, tā yī rán jué de kōng xū.) - Even after success, she still felt hollow.  
- 长时间独处会让人产生空虚感。(cháng shí jiān dú chǔ huì ràng rén chǎn shēng kōng xū gǎn.) - Long periods of solitude can cause a feeling of emptiness.

**Usage Notes**:  
**空虚** (kōng xū) describes emotional or spiritual emptiness, not physical emptiness. Common in psychological or literary contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of **空** (kōng, "empty") as an "empty cave" and **虚** (xū, "void") as "clouds drifting with nothing inside"-together, they mean an empty, hollow feeling.
