# **腰 (yāo) - Waist**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 腰 (yāo):
  - Left: 月 (yuè, “flesh” radical, associated with body parts)
  - Right: 要 (yào, meaning “to want/need”; here, serves as a phonetic component)
  - The character suggests a body part (with the “flesh” radical) related to “core/essential part” (from 要 (yào))-the waist.

**Examples**:  
- 我的腰 (wǒ de yāo) 很酸。(hěn suān) - My waist is very sore.  
- 她的腰 (tā de yāo) 很细。(hěn xì) - Her waist is very slim.  
- 请不要扭伤腰 (qǐng bù yào niǔshāng yāo)。- Please don’t twist your waist.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 腰 (yāo) refers specifically to the lower back/waist area.  
- Common in health, fitness, or clothing contexts (e.g., 腰带 (yāodài) - “belt”).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine the “flesh” radical 月 (yuè) as the body, and 要 (yào) as cradling it at the waist-the body’s crucial middle part.
