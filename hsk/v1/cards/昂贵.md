# **昂贵 (áng guì) - Expensive**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **昂** (áng): "To raise (the head), proud." Top: "日" (rì, sun) suggests brightness; bottom: "卬" (áng), sounds like the character, indicating lifting up.  
- **贵** (guì): "Expensive, precious." Top: "中" (zhōng, center) inside "贝" (bèi, cowrie shell, ancient money) at the bottom, linking to value and cost.

**Examples**:  
- 这辆车很昂贵。(Zhè liàng chē hěn áng guì.) - This car is very expensive.  
- 她买了一件昂贵的裙子。(Tā mǎi le yí jiàn áng guì de qún zi.) - She bought an expensive dress.  
- 昂贵的药品让人负担不起。(Áng guì de yào pǐn ràng rén fù dān bù qǐ.) - Expensive medicines are unaffordable for people.

**Usage Notes**:  
"昂贵" (áng guì) is formal and describes high price or value, often for products, services, or luxury items. Less commonly used in daily speech than "贵" (guì), which is more general.

**Memory Aids**:  
Remember "昂" (áng) as something "raising up" the price, and "贵" (guì) as "precious" because of the valuable "shell" at the bottom - together, "昂贵" (áng guì) means the price is HIGH!
