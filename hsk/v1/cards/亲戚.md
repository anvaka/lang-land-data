# **亲戚 (qīnqi) - Relative**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **亲** (qīn): "relative, parent, close"
  - Left: "見" (jiàn, see) as radical.
  - Right/top: "亲" simplifies "親", original top is "亲" (qīn, intimate).  
- **戚** (qi): "relative, relation"
  - Left: "戈" (gē, spear/halberd).
  - Right: "小" (xiǎo, small) at bottom inside enclosure.

**Examples**:  
- 我 (wǒ) 有 (yǒu) 很多 (hěn duō) 亲戚 (qīnqi)。 (Wǒ yǒu hěn duō qīnqi.) - I have many relatives.  
- 明天 (míngtiān) 我们 (wǒmen) 要 (yào) 去 (qù) 看 (kàn) 亲戚 (qīnqi)。 (Míngtiān wǒmen yào qù kàn qīnqi.) - We are going to visit relatives tomorrow.  
- 你 (nǐ) 亲戚 (qīnqi) 住在 (zhù zài) 哪儿 (nǎr)？(Nǐ qīnqi zhù zài nǎr?) - Where do your relatives live?

**Usage Notes**:  
- 亲戚 (qīnqi) refers to all relatives (by blood or marriage), not just close family.  
- Used as both singular and plural.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 亲 (qīn) means "close"; 戚 (qi) sounds like "see", so "close people you see = relatives".
