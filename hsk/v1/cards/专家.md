# **专家 (zhuān jiā) - Expert; Specialist**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **专 (zhuān)**: "Specialized" or "focused." Top: "一 (yī)" (one, horizontal stroke), below is "小 (xiǎo)" (small), signifying something uniquely focused.  
- **家 (jiā)**: "Home," "family," or "expert." Top: "宀 (mián)" (roof radical, top), middle: "豕 (shǐ)" (pig, bottom), historically meaning a house with a pig inside, symbolizing wealth or stability; extended to mean a person of a particular field.

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 是 (shì) 语言 (yǔ yán) 专家 (zhuān jiā)。 (Tā shì yǔ yán zhuān jiā.) - He is a language expert.  
- 我们 (wǒ men) 请 (qǐng) 了 (le) 一位 (yí wèi) 专家 (zhuān jiā) 来 (lái) 帮助 (bāng zhù) 我们 (wǒ men)。 (Wǒ men qǐng le yí wèi zhuān jiā lái bāng zhù wǒ men.) - We invited an expert to help us.  
- 这 (zhè) 件 (jiàn) 事 (shì) 需要 (xū yào) 专家 (zhuān jiā) 意见 (yì jiàn)。 (Zhè jiàn shì xū yào zhuān jiā yì jiàn.) - This matter needs an expert's opinion.

**Usage Notes**:  
专家 (zhuān jiā) is typically used as a noun to describe someone with deep knowledge in a specific field. It can be used on its own or with a field of expertise before it, e.g., 医学专家 (yī xué zhuān jiā) - medical expert.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 专 (zhuān) as "focusing intensely," and 家 (jiā) as "an accomplished person in a field (like the head of a knowledgeable family)." Together, 专家 (zhuān jiā) is someone who has mastered their specialty.
