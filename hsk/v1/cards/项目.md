**Character Breakdown**:  
- **项 (xiàng)**:
  - Top: 亠 (tóu) "lid,"
  - Bottom: 页 (yè) "page/head."
  - Originally meant "neck," now also means "item" or "category."  
- **目 (mù)**:
  - Top: 目 (mù) "eye" radical, pictograph of an eye.

- Often used in formal/written contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think of 项 (xiàng) as an "item" on top of a "page" (页 (yè)), and 目 (mù) as your "eye" scanning a list-together: an item you notice, i.e., project or entry.
