- 扇 (shàn): Means "fan." The left side is 扌(tí shǒu páng)-the "hand" radical (indicating use by hand); the right side is 戶(hù)-means "door," suggesting something moving like a door or fan.  
- 子 (zi): Means "child" or is used as a noun suffix. The single horizontal stroke (top) over a curved enclosure (middle/bottom), ending with two strokes (bottom) resembling baby legs-visualizing a child.

**Examples**:

- 扇子(shànzi)可以(kěyǐ)用来(yònglái)跳舞(tiàowǔ)。 (Fans can be used for dancing.)

**Usage Notes**:  
- 扇子(shànzi) is a countable noun; use 把(bǎ) as the measure word: 一把(yì bǎ)扇子(shànzi) = "one fan."  
- Common in cultural contexts, especially for traditional dance or cooling.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine using your hand (扌[tí shǒu páng]) to move a door (戶[hù]) back and forth, like fanning yourself with 扇子(shànzi).  
- 子(zi) as a diminutive makes it easy to remember as a small, handy item.
