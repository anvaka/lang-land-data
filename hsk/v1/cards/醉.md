# **醉 (zuì) - drunk; intoxicated**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 醉 (zuì):
  - Left side: 酉 (yǒu), wine/alcohol radical (means “wine vessel,” appears on left; indicates relation to alcohol).
  - Right side: 卆 (zú), phonetic component (top: 十(shí), “ten”; bottom: 卩(jié), “seal”).

**Examples**:  
- 他醉了。(Tā zuì le.) - He is drunk.  
- 她从不喝醉。(Tā cóng bù hē zuì.) - She never gets drunk.  
- 喝多了容易醉。(Hē duō le róngyì zuì.) - Drinking too much makes it easy to get drunk.

**Usage Notes**:  
醉 (zuì) is often used with verbs like 喝 (hē, drink): 喝醉 (hē zuì) - to get drunk. Both literal and figurative uses (e.g., 陶醉 (táo zuì), to be enchanted).

**Memory Aids**:  
酉 (yǒu, wine) + 卆 (zú, similar to “final”) = your final state after too much wine: drunk!
