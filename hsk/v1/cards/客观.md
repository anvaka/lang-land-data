# **客观 (kèguān) - Objective**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **客** (kè): Guest, visitor. Left: 宀 (mián, "roof" radical) on top suggests a building, enclosing 夂 (zhǐ, "go") and 口 (kǒu, "mouth") underneath, hinting at a "visiting person under a roof."  
- **观** (guān): To observe, view. Left: 见 (jiàn, "see") on the right side, combined with 又 (yòu, "again") on the left, forming the idea of repeat observation or viewing.

**Examples**:  
- 我们要保持客观。(Wǒmen yào bǎochí kèguān.) - We need to remain objective.  
- 他用客观的态度分析问题。(Tā yòng kèguān de tàidù fēnxī wèntí.) - He analyzes problems with an objective attitude.  
- 新闻报道应该尽量客观。(Xīnwén bàodào yīnggāi jǐnliàng kèguān.) - News reports should be as objective as possible.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **客观** (kèguān) is mostly used for describing things as neutral, unbiased, or based on facts. Opposite: **主观** (zhǔguān, subjective). Often used with nouns like **态度** (tàidù, attitude), **事实** (shìshí, fact), etc.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a **guest** (**客** kè) views (**观** guān) things fairly-guests should be neutral, just observing!
