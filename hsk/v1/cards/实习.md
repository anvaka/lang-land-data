- 实 (shí): "real, true"
  - Radical: 宀 (mián, "roof") on top, indicating "house" or "shelter."
  - Component: 头 (tóu, "head") at the bottom, relates to actual/true nature.  
- 习 (xí): "to practice, to study"

实习 (shíxí) is used both as a noun ("an internship") and as a verb ("to intern"). It is common in academic and professional contexts.

Think "实 (shí, real)" + "习 (xí, practice)" = "real practice" in a work setting-what an internship is all about!
