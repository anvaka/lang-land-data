# **遥控 (yáokòng) - Remote control**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **遥 (yáo)**: “Far, distant.” Left: 辶 (chuò) movement radical; right: 尧 (yáo), phonetic component.  
- **控 (kòng)**: “Control.” Left: 扌(shǒu) hand radical; right: 空 (kōng) meaning "empty" or "space," used here phonetically and semantically.

**Examples**:  
- 请给我遥控器。(Qǐng gěi wǒ yáokòng qì.) - Please give me the remote control.  
- 他用遥控开了电视。(Tā yòng yáokòng kāi le diànshì.) - He turned on the TV with the remote.  
- 遥控汽车很有趣。(Yáokòng qìchē hěn yǒuqù.) - Remote-controlled cars are fun.

**Usage Notes**:  
遥控 (yáokòng) can be both a verb ("to control remotely") and part of a noun, such as 遥控器 (yáokòng qì, remote control device). Commonly used for electronics, toys, or machinery.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 遥 (yáo) as “far away” (用辶 (chuò), you walk far), and 控 (kòng) as “control with your hand” (left: 手 (shǒu)). So, “control from far away” = 遥控 (yáokòng).
