# **诞辰 (dànchén) - birthday (formal; often for important figures)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **诞** (dàn): Left side is 讠(yán) "speech" radical; right side is "延" (yán: to prolong). Originally means "birth" or "be born."  
- **辰** (chén): Represents "time" or "celestial body"; pictograph of a plow in the field, associated with the "dragon" zodiac and the time of day.

**Examples**:  
- 今天是他的诞辰。(Jīntiān shì tā de dànchén.) - Today is his birthday.  
- 我们纪念他的诞辰。(Wǒmen jìniàn tā de dànchén.) - We commemorate his birthday.  
- 诞辰庆典十分隆重。(Dànchén qìngdiǎn shífēn lóngzhòng.) - The birthday celebration is very grand.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **诞辰** (dànchén) is formal and mainly used for historical figures, leaders, or special occasions, not for ordinary birthdays (use **生日** [shēngrì] for common usage).

**Memory Aids**:  
- **诞** (dàn): "Speech" (讠[yán]) about a "new extension" (延[yán])-announcing a birth.  
- **辰** (chén): Think of the dragon’s hour, a significant moment-just like a special birthday.
