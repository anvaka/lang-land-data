# **由 (yóu) - from; by; due to**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 由 (yóu): The top is a horizontal line (indicating "field" or "origin"), and the bottom is a vertical stroke through a rectangle, symbolizing a source or cause. The character suggests something arising from a starting point.

**Examples**:  
- 由(yóu)我(wǒ)来(lái)负(fù)责(zé)。(yóu wǒ lái fùzé.) - I am responsible.  
- 这(zhè)件(jiàn)事(shì)由(yóu)他(tā)决(jué)定(dìng)。(zhè jiàn shì yóu tā juédìng.) - This matter is decided by him.  
- 由(yóu)于(yú)下雨(xiàyǔ)，比(bǐ)赛(sài)取(qǔ)消(xiāo)了(le)。(yóu yú xiàyǔ, bǐsài qǔxiāo le.) - Due to rain, the game was canceled.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 由(yóu) is often used to indicate the agent ("by"), the source ("from"), or the reason ("due to").  
- "由(yóu)...来(lái)..." means "by... (sb.)", focusing on who does something.  
- "由(yóu)于(yú)..." means "because of" or "due to".

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think of 由(yóu) as a path starting "from" a point; the vertical line "leads out" from its origin.  
- 由(yóu) looks like a keyhole: a source (where things come "from" or are "caused by").
