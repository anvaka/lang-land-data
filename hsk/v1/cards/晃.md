# **晃 (huǎng/huàng) - to sway; to shake; to dazzle**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 晃 (huǎng/huàng): Left side is 日 (rì) "sun" (left), right side is 光 (guāng) "light" (right). The sun and light together suggest brightness or movement related to light.

**Examples**:

- 他故意晃了晃脑袋。(Tā gùyì huàng le huǎng nǎodai.) - He deliberately shook his head.  
- 阳光晃得我睁不开眼。(Yángguāng huǎng de wǒ zhēng bù kāi yǎn.) - The sunlight dazzled me so I couldn't open my eyes.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 晃 (huǎng/huàng) is both verb and descriptive, used for swaying, shaking, or dazzling motions.  
- Pronounced "huǎng" for "to sway/dazzle," and "huàng" often in quick, intentional shakes or as verb complement (e.g., 晃了晃 (huàng le huǎng)).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine the sun (日 (rì)) shining so brightly it makes things light (光 (guāng)) seem to move-this is 晃 (huǎng/huàng), to shake or dazzle.
