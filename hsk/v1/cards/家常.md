# **家常 (jiācháng) - Home-style; everyday (usually about food or daily life)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **家** (jiā): "home, family." The top is 宀 (mián, "roof") representing a house; under the roof is 豕 (shǐ, "pig"), symbolizing a pig kept at home in ancient times.  
- **常** (cháng): "often, usual." Top is 宀 (mián, "roof"); middle is 尚 (shàng), which here gives sound and meaning related to "constant" or "usual."

**Examples**:  
- 这家餐馆有很多家常菜。(Zhè jiā cānguǎn yǒu hěn duō jiācháng cài.) - This restaurant has many home-style dishes.  
- 我喜欢家常的生活。(Wǒ xǐhuan jiācháng de shēnghuó.) - I like everyday (simple) life.  
- 他做了一顿家常饭。(Tā zuò le yí dùn jiācháng fàn.) - He made a home-style meal.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **家常** (jiācháng) is most often used to describe food (**家常菜** jiācháng cài: home-style dishes), or as an adjective meaning "ordinary" in the context of daily or home life.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine **家** (jiā, "home") plus **常** (cháng, "usual") = what you usually do/eat at home → "home-style"/"everyday."
