# **救 (jiù) - to save; to rescue**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **救 (jiù)**
  - Left: 攵 (pū) - "action" radical (right side hand, indicating actions like hitting or doing)
  - Right: 求 (qiú) - "to seek" (top: 丶 (zhǔ) dot, bottom: 水 (shuǐ) water variant form)
  - Overall: combining "seeking" and "action" = to take action to help/save

**Examples**:  
- 他救了我的命。(Tā jiù le wǒ de mìng.) - He saved my life.  
- 消防员正在救火。(Xiāofángyuán zhèngzài jiù huǒ.) - The firefighter is putting out the fire (rescuing from fire).  
- 请救救我！(Qǐng jiùjiu wǒ!) - Please save me!

**Usage Notes**:  
- **救 (jiù)** is usually about saving people or situations from danger or trouble, not related to financial savings or computer 'save' (use 保存 (bǎocún) for that).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Picture someone taking action (攵(pū)) to seek (求(qiú)) and save someone in danger.  
- "救 (jiù)" sounds like "chew"-think: "Chew" the problem and rescue the solution!
