# **艰难 (jiān nán) - Difficult; Hard**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **艰 (jiān)**: "Difficult." Left: "⺈" (dāo, knife radical), right: "又" (yòu, right hand); together implying difficulty or something hard to overcome.  
- **难 (nán)**: "Hard; difficult." Left: "隹" (zhuī, short-tailed bird), right: "又" (yòu, right hand); historically, catching birds by hand is difficult.

- Adjective: often followed by nouns like 时刻 (shí kè, moments), 生活 (shēnghuó, life), 抉择 (juézé, choices).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine using a knife (⺈, dāo) with just your hand (又, yòu) to do something-quite "difficult" (艰 jiān)!  
- Difficult as catching a bird (隹, zhuī) by hand (又, yòu) - that's "hard" (难 nán)!
