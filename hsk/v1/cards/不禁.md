# **不禁 (bù jīn) - Can't help (doing something); can't refrain from**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **不 (bù)**: "No; not." The top is a short horizontal line, under which is a vertical line with a short left-falling stroke on the left (like a "T" with a slant).  
- **禁 (jīn)**: "Forbid; restrain." Left and right side: 林 (lín, "forest") = two 木 (mù, "wood/trees") side by side; Top: 示 (shì, "to show, spirit") radical, here as 禁's top component.

**Examples**:  
- 听到这个消息，她不禁 (bù jīn) 哭了出来。(tīng dào zhè ge xiāo xi, tā bù jīn kū le chū lái.) - Hearing the news, she couldn't help but cry.  
- 他的话让我们不禁 (bù jīn) 发笑。(tā de huà ràng wǒ men bù jīn fā xiào.) - His words made us burst out laughing.  
- 看到旧照片，我不禁 (bù jīn) 想起了童年。(kàn dào jiù zhào piàn, wǒ bù jīn xiǎng qǐ le tóng nián.) - Seeing the old photos, I couldn't help remembering my childhood.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 不禁 (bù jīn) is used before a verb to express an involuntary reaction (often emotional).  
- Usually in written or literary Chinese, but also appears in speech.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine "不 (bù)" as a stop sign, and "禁 (jīn)" as "forbid/barrier." Together, "so forbidden you CAN'T HELP IT!"
