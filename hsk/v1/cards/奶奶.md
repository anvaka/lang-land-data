# **奶奶 (nǎinai) - Paternal grandmother**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 奶 (nǎi): Means "milk" or "female elder." Left: 女 (nǚ, "female") radical; right: 乃 (nǎi, "to be," "thus").  
- 奶 (nǎi): Repeated for affectionate emphasis. The second 奶 (nǎi) is not a different word, just a reduplication.

**Examples**:

- 奶奶做了好吃的饭。(Nǎinai zuòle hǎochī de fàn.) - Grandma cooked delicious food.  
- 奶奶正在看电视。(Nǎinai zhèngzài kàn diànshì.) - Grandma is watching TV.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 奶奶 (nǎinai) refers only to the father’s mother. The mother’s mother is called 外婆 (wàipó).  
- Commonly used in northern and southern China.

**Memory Aids**:  
- "奶 (nǎi)" sounds like "nana" in English, which can mean grandmother. Two "奶 (nǎi)" makes it extra affectionate!
