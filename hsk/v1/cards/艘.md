# **艘 (sōu) - Measure word for ships, boats**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **艘 (sōu)**:
  - Radical on the left: **舟 (zhōu)** ("boat")-left side, indicates connection to water/boats.
  - Right side: **叟 (sǒu)**-right side, originally means "old man," acts as a phonetic component.

**Examples**:  
- 一艘船 (yī sōu chuán) - One boat  
- 三艘军舰 (sān sōu jūn jiàn) - Three warships  
- 那艘渔船很大 (nà sōu yú chuán hěn dà) - That fishing boat is big

**Usage Notes**:  
- **艘 (sōu)** is a measure word used ONLY for ships or large boats, never for small watercraft like canoes.  
- Grammar: Placed between a numeral and the noun, e.g., "两艘船 (liǎng sōu chuán)" - "two boats."

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think of the **舟 (zhōu)** boat radical on the left to remind you it is for ships.  
- "Sōu" sounds like "so" big-use for big boats!
