# **倍 (bèi) - times; fold; multiple**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 倍 (bèi): On the left is 亻 (rén) "person" radical, and on the right is 咅 (pǒu) indicating pronunciation, meaning "multiple" or "double." The concept comes from "person" + "repeat/add" = one person multiplied.

**Examples**:  
- 价格翻了一倍。(Jiàgé fān le yí bèi.) - The price doubled.  
- 他跑得比我快三倍。(Tā pǎo de bǐ wǒ kuài sān bèi.) - He runs three times faster than me.  
- 这里的人数是去年的两倍。(Zhèlǐ de rénshù shì qùnián de liǎng bèi.) - The number of people here is twice as many as last year.

**Usage Notes**:  
倍 (bèi) is used after a number to express multiplication (e.g., 三倍 (sān bèi): three times). Often used with phrases indicating amounts or factors.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine 亻 (rén) "person" being doubled or multiplied-one person becomes many (倍 (bèi): times/multiple).
