# **赤字 (chì zì) - Deficit; Budget Shortfall**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **赤 (chì)**: "Red." Left side is "土 (tǔ)" (earth) on the bottom; top is "大 (dà)" (big), symbolizing nakedness or being bare.  
- **字 (zì)**: "Character/word," but here, "money/amount." Top is "宀 (mián)" (roof), bottom is "子 (zǐ)" (child), originally meaning a child under a roof (to write or learn).

**Examples**:  
- 这个公司有很大的赤字。(Zhè ge gōngsī yǒu hěn dà de chìzì.) - This company has a big deficit.  
- 政府正在努力减少赤字。(Zhèngfǔ zhèngzài nǔlì jiǎnshǎo chìzì.) - The government is working to reduce the deficit.  
- 贸易赤字逐年上升。(Màoyì chìzì zhúnián shàngshēng.) - The trade deficit is rising year by year.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 赤字 (chìzì) is mainly used in finance (budgets, trade).  
- Opposite: 盈余 (yíngyú) - surplus.  
- Often used with 预算 (yùsuàn - budget), 贸易 (màoyì - trade).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think of “赤 (chì)” as "red," meaning “in the red” (debt), and “字 (zì)” as numbers (amount), so “red numbers” = deficit.
