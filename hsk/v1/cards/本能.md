# **本能 (běn néng) - Instinct, instinctive ability**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **本 (běn)**: Root, origin, basis. Consists of 木 (mù, "wood/tree") with an extra horizontal line at the bottom (representing the "root").  
- **能 (néng)**: Ability, can. Top is the character 厶 (sī, "private") inside 月 (yuè, "moon/meat") and below is 匕 (bǐ, "spoon"), suggesting capability.

**Examples**:  
- 动物有求生本能。(Dòngwù yǒu qiúshēng běnnéng.) - Animals have the instinct to survive.  
- 他下意识地用本能躲开了危险。(Tā xiàyìshí de yòng běnnéng duǒkāi le wēixiǎn.) - He instinctively avoided danger.  
- 母亲的关爱是一种本能。(Mǔqīn de guān'ài shì yì zhǒng běnnéng.) - A mother's care is a kind of instinct.

**Usage Notes**:  
本能 (běnnéng) is usually a noun, often preceded by possessive or descriptive words (e.g., 生存本能 (shēngcún běnnéng), “survival instinct”). Used for natural, unlearned reactions or tendencies.

**Memory Aids**:  
本 (běn) = "root"/"origin"; 能 (néng) = "ability." Instinct is our “root ability”-the abilities we have from the very beginning.
