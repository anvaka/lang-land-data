# **寿命 (shòumìng) - Lifespan; life expectancy**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **寿** (shòu): At the top is "⺷" (yáng, sheep), symbolizing longevity; below is "寸" (cùn, inch/measurement), suggesting length of life.  
- **命** (mìng): Top is "亼" (jí, gather) above "口" (kǒu, mouth), over "卩" (jié, seal/kneel). Refers to a decree or fate-something 'given' or 'commanded.'

**Examples**:  
- 乌龟(wūguī)的寿命(shòumìng)很长(hěn cháng)。- Turtles have a long lifespan.  
- 他的寿命(shòumìng)比平均(bǐ píngjūn)长(cháng)。- His lifespan is longer than average.  
- 科学家(kēxuéjiā)研究(yánjiū)动物(dòngwù)的寿命(shòumìng)。- Scientists study the lifespan of animals.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **寿命** (shòumìng) is used for living things (people, animals, plants), not for objects.  
- Often used in scientific or formal contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
- **寿** (shòu): Imagine a long "inch" (寸, cùn) ruler measuring someone's life-a long life!  
- **命** (mìng): Your "mouth" (口, kǒu) receives the "command" (亼+卩, jí+jié) of how long you'll live.
