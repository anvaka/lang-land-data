# **运行 (yùn xíng) - to operate; to run (e.g., a system)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 运 (yùn): "to transport, move". Left = 辶 (chuò, "movement" radical) on the left, 𠂇 (yùn) on the right.  
- 行 (xíng): "to go, to walk". Top = 彳 (chì, "step" radical), bottom = 亍 (chù).

**Examples**:  
- 电脑运行很快。(diàn nǎo yùn xíng hěn kuài) - The computer runs very fast.  
- 程序正在运行。(chéng xù zhèng zài yùn xíng) - The program is running.  
- 火车开始运行了。(huǒ chē kāi shǐ yùn xíng le) - The train has started running.

**Usage Notes**:  
运行 (yùn xíng) is often used for machines, systems, or processes, not for physical exercise. More formal than 跑 (pǎo), which means "to run (physically)".

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: “运 (yùn, move/transport) + 行 (xíng, walk/go) = makes things move/operate together.”
