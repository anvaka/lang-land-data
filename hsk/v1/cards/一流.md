# **一流 (yī liú) - First-class; top-tier**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **一** (yī): Means "one" or "the best." It’s a single horizontal line.  
- **流** (liú): Means "flow" or "stream." Left side: "氵" (shuǐ) water radical; right side: "㐬" (liú), a phonetic component.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **一流** (yī liú) is mainly used as an adjective before a noun or after a verb phrase to describe high quality or ranking.  
- Common in business, services, skills, or people.

**Memory Aids**:  
- "One" (**一** (yī)) "stream" (**流** (liú)): The only stream = the best, the first-rate!  
- Imagine all other "streams" following behind the "first flow"-the leader is always 一流 (yī liú)!
