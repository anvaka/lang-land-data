- **安** (ān): "Peace, safe." Top: 宀 (mián, roof radical) = shelter/protection; Bottom: 女 (nǚ, woman) = an ancient symbol of tranquility.  
- **慰** (wèi): "Console, comfort." Bottom: 心 (xīn, heart radical) = feelings/emotions; Top: 尉 (wèi, official/military), suggesting authority applied gently.

**Usage Notes**:  
安慰 (ān wèi) is used for emotional support-spoken or physical comfort. It’s both a verb and, rarely, a noun (e.g., 得到( dé dào )安慰( ān wèi ): "receive comfort").

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "A woman (女 nǚ) under a roof (宀 mián) brings peace (安 ān), using her heart (忄xīn) to comfort (慰 wèi) others."
