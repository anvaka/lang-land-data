# **空 (kōng) - empty; sky; free time**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 空 (kōng): Top: 宀 (mián) "roof" indicating a building or space;
  Bottom: 工 (gōng) "work" or "structure." Together, suggests "space under a roof" - hence, "empty" or "sky."

**Examples**:  
- 房间里很空。(Fángjiān lǐ hěn kōng.) - The room is very empty.  
- 今天你有空吗？(Jīntiān nǐ yǒu kòng ma?) - Do you have free time today?  
- 天空很蓝。(Tiānkōng hěn lán.) - The sky is very blue.

**Usage Notes**:  
空 (kōng) can mean "empty," "sky," or "free (time)" depending on context.  
As "free time," use 有空 (yǒu kòng).  
天空 (tiānkōng) = "sky."

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine looking up at the moon (宀 (mián)) from inside a building and seeing only empty space (空 (kōng)) above.空 (kōng) = empty or sky.
