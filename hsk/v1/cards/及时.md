# **及时 (jí shí) - Timely / In time**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **及 (jí)**:
  - Meaning: to reach, to catch up
  - Structure: "又 (yòu)" (again, right side), and "人 (rén)" (person, inside bottom), suggesting someone reaching out.  
- **时 (shí)**:
  - Meaning: time, hour
  - Structure: Left: "日 (rì)" (sun/day/time, left side); Right: "寺 (sì)" (temple, right side), commonly used as phonetic.

**Examples**:  
- 请 (qǐng) 及时 (jí shí) 回答 (huí dá)。 (Please reply in time.)  
- 司机 (sī jī) 及时 (jí shí) 刹车 (shā chē) 了。 (The driver braked in time.)  
- 她 (tā) 及时 (jí shí) 完成 (wán chéng) 了 工作 (gōng zuò)。 (She finished the work on time.)

**Usage Notes**:  
- 及时 (jí shí) is often used adverbially before verbs, meaning “promptly” or “without delay.”  
- Can express both a warning (“make sure you do it on time”) and praise (“you did it promptly”).

**Memory Aids**:  
- 及 (jí): Imagine someone stretching OUT (right side) to reach a GOAL.  
- 时 (shí): The SUN (日 rì, left) tells us the TIME. Together: reach the time → just in time!
