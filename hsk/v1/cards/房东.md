# **房东 (fángdōng) - Landlord**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 房 (fáng): "house; building"
  - Left: 宀 (mián, "roof" radical) = shelter/top
  - Right: 方 (fāng, "square")  
- 东 (dōng): "east; owner (in this context)"
  - Top: 一 (yī, "one")
  - Bottom: 小 (xiǎo, "small")
  - Center: 八 (bā, "eight"/component form)

**Examples**:  
- 我的房东 (wǒ de fángdōng) 很友好。(hěn yǒuhǎo.) - My landlord is very friendly.  
- 房东 (fángdōng) 不让我们养宠物。(bù ràng wǒmen yǎng chǒngwù.) - The landlord doesn’t allow us to keep pets.  
- 你见过房东 (nǐ jiànguò fángdōng) 吗？(ma?) - Have you met the landlord?

**Usage Notes**:  
房东 (fángdōng) refers to the owner renting out a place, not a "host" in general. For an apartment owner renting out, always use 房东 (fángdōng).

**Memory Aids**:  
房 (fáng) = house, 东 (dōng) = east/owner. Picture the "owner of the house" as the one whose door faces "east," where the sun rises-leading (like a landlord leads tenants).
