# **敞开 (chǎng kāi) - open wide, open up**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **敞** (chǎng): On the left is the “攵” (pū, rap) radical, indicating an action, and on the right, “尚” (shàng, still/yet). The overall character suggests an action of making space or opening.  
- **开** (kāi): Top is “一” (yī, one), bottom is “廾” (gǒng, two hands), together meaning to open or start.

**Examples**:  
- 请把窗户敞开。(Qǐng bǎ chuānghu chǎngkāi.) - Please open the window wide.  
- 他愿意敞开心扉和我们谈谈。(Tā yuànyì chǎngkāi xīnfēi hé wǒmen tán tán.) - He is willing to open his heart and talk with us.  
- 大门敞开着，欢迎大家。(Dàmén chǎngkāi zhe, huānyíng dàjiā.) - The gate is open wide, welcoming everyone.

**Usage Notes**:  
**敞开** (chǎngkāi) can be used literally (open doors/windows wide) and figuratively (open up emotionally or express freely). Often paired with objects like 门 (mén, door), 窗 (chuāng, window), or 心扉 (xīnfēi, heart).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of **敞** (chǎng) as "action + space" and **开** (kāi) as "opening." Picture hands pushing something fully open, symbolizing both physical and emotional openness.
