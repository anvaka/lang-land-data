# **年纪 (niánjì) - age**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 年 (nián): "Year." Top: "冂" (jiōng) open enclosure, inside: "禾" (hé) meaning "grain/rice." Symbolizes crops harvested annually → year.  
- 纪 (jì): "Record," "period." Left: "纟" (sī) silk radical, associated with thread or continuity. Right: "己" (jǐ) self, here gives sound. Together: thread of years → period/record.

**Examples**:  
- 你的年纪 (nǐ de niánjì) - Your age  
- 她的年纪很小 (tā de niánjì hěn xiǎo) - She is very young  
- 请问您今年多大年纪 (qǐngwèn nín jīnnián duō dà niánjì) - May I ask your age this year?

**Usage Notes**:  
年纪 (niánjì) is most often used for people and sounds slightly formal or polite. For asking age, bigger context or respect is implied-compared to 年龄 (niánlíng), which is more technical.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 年 (nián) for “year” + 纪 (jì)’s “thread” as the “thread of years”-the record of years you’ve lived = age.
