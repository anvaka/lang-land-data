# **才 (cái) - just; only; talent**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **才** (cái): The character has a simple structure. The “一” (yī, one) stroke is at the top, signifying the beginning. Below, the “丿” (piě, left-falling stroke) and “亅” (jué, hook) make up the rest. The character originally depicted a sprout just emerging, suggesting "just now" or "talent just revealed".

**Examples**:  
- 我(wǒ)才(cái)到(dào)。 (Wǒ cái dào.) - I just arrived.  
- 他(tā)才(cái)五(wǔ)岁(suì)。 (Tā cái wǔ suì.) - He is only five years old.  
- 她(tā)很(hěn)有(yǒu)才(cái)华(huá)。 (Tā hěn yǒu cái huá.) - She is very talented.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **才** (cái) is used for emphasis: “just now”, “only”, or referring to someone’s talent.  
- Placed before verbs for time (recent/just), before numbers for small amounts, and to describe ability.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a sprout **just** (才, cái) poking out of the ground-something **just** beginning, **only** just appeared.  
- The top stroke “一” (yī) can remind you of a surface; what is **just** coming out below it is "才" (cái).
