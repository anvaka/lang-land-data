# **生物 (shēngwù) - Biology; Living thing**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 生 (shēng): "Life," "to be born," "to grow." Top: "grass" (艹(cǎo)) radical (a symbol for plant/life), bottom: "soil" (土(tǔ)) and "a line indicating growth."  
- 物 (wù): "Thing," "object." Left: "cow" (牜(niú)) radical, right: "not" (勿(wù)), often used as a phonetic component.

**Examples**:  
- 我(wǒ)喜欢(xǐhuān)学习(xuéxí)生物(shēngwù)。(Wǒ xǐhuān xuéxí shēngwù.) - I like studying biology.  
- 生物(shēngwù)在(zài)地球(dìqiú)上(shàng)很(hěn)重要(zhòngyào)。(Shēngwù zài dìqiú shàng hěn zhòngyào.) - Living things are important on Earth.  
- 他(tā)是一名(shì yì míng)生物学家(shēngwù xuéjiā)。(Tā shì yì míng shēngwù xuéjiā.) - He is a biologist.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 生物(shēngwù) can mean "living thing" (a plant, animal, etc.), "biology" (the subject), or shorthand for "biological" in compounds.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 生(shēng) looks like a plant sprouting (life); 物(wù) is a "thing" (picture a cow as an important thing in ancient times). Together: the "life thing"-a living thing or biology!
