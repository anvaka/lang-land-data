# **毫米 (háomǐ) - millimeter**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 毫 (háo): "tiny," "minute." The top is 毛 (máo, "hair"); the bottom is an extra stroke, emphasizing smallness-something even thinner than hair.  
- 米 (mǐ): "rice." The character depicts a grain of rice; 米 (mǐ) often represents "meter" in measurements.

**Examples**:  
- 这根线只有一毫米。(Zhè gēn xiàn zhǐ yǒu yī háomǐ.) - This thread is only one millimeter thick.  
- 雨量达到五毫米。(Yǔliàng dádào wǔ háomǐ.) - Rainfall reached five millimeters.  
- 请测量毫米数。(Qǐng cèliáng háomǐ shù.) - Please measure the number of millimeters.

**Usage Notes**:  
毫米 (háomǐ) is the standard SI unit for millimeters in Chinese. Used for precise measurements, always as a noun and frequently after a number.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: 毫 (háo) = "hair," so 毫米 (háomǐ) is a "hair-sized meter" → very tiny, like a millimeter.
