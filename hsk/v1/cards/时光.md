# **时光 (shí guāng) - Time; the passage of time**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 时 (shí): "Time" or "hour." Left: 日 (rì, "sun/day" radical), indicating connection to time or days. Right: 寺 (sì, "temple"), which provides the sound.  
- 光 (guāng): "Light." Top: 冖 (mì, "cover"). Bottom: 儿 (ér, "child/legs"). Suggests light emanating or radiating.

**Examples**:  
- 时光 (shí guāng)飞逝 (fēi shì)。- Time flies.  
- 我们 (wǒ men)珍惜 (zhēn xī)在一起的时光 (zài yì qǐ de shí guāng)。- We cherish the time spent together.  
- 童年的时光 (tóng nián de shí guāng)很美好 (hěn měi hǎo)。- Childhood time is beautiful.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 时光 (shí guāng) is poetic, often refers to memories or the fleeting quality of time, rather than precise hours/minutes.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine "time" (时 shí) is marked by the "sun" (日 rì) rising and setting each day, while "light" (光 guāng) passes quickly, just as time slips away.
