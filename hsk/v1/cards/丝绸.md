# **丝绸 (sīchóu) - Silk**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 丝 (sī): Means "silk". Top to bottom: the radical "纟(sī)" (silk thread) signals relation to fabrics.  
- 绸 (chóu): Means "silk fabric". Left/right: left is "纟(sī)" (silk), right is "周(zhōu)" meaning "around/circle" (phonetic component).

**Examples**:  
- 这件衣服是丝绸做的。(Zhè jiàn yīfu shì sīchóu zuò de.) - This dress is made of silk.  
- 中国以丝绸闻名世界。(Zhōngguó yǐ sīchóu wénmíng shìjiè.) - China is famous worldwide for silk.  
- 丝绸很光滑柔软。(Sīchóu hěn guānghuá róuruǎn.) - Silk is smooth and soft.

**Usage Notes**:  
丝绸 (sīchóu) is used for the material, not for a piece of silk (that’s often called 丝巾 (sī jīn) = silk scarf). Commonly seen as 丝绸之路 (sīchóu zhī lù) "Silk Road".

**Memory Aids**:  
Both characters contain the silk radical 纟(sī) on left/top: think of threads woven to form luxurious Chinese silk fabric.
