# **秒 (miǎo) - second (unit of time)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 秒 (miǎo):
  - Left: 禾 (hé) - "grain" radical; suggests connection to grains
  - Right: 少 (shǎo) - "few/little"; indicates something small or brief

**Examples**:  
- 一秒钟 (yī miǎo zhōng) - one second  
- 他只迟到了一秒 (tā zhǐ chí dào le yī miǎo) - He was only one second late  
- 请等我三秒 (qǐng děng wǒ sān miǎo) - Please wait for me for three seconds

**Usage Notes**:  
秒 (miǎo) is a measure word for time, equal to one sixtieth of a minute. Often paired with 钟 (zhōng) as 秒钟 (miǎo zhōng).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think "grain (禾 hé) of time is very small (少 shǎo)"-just like a second is a tiny amount of time.
