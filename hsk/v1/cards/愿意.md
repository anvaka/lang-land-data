# **愿意 (yuàn yì) - willing; to be willing**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 愿 (yuàn): "wish; desire." Left: 忄(xīn) (heart radical), indicating emotion; right: 原 (yuán) (origin/base), suggesting the source of one's feelings.  
- 意 (yì): "meaning; idea." Top: 音 (yīn) (sound); bottom: 心 (xīn) (heart), indicates thoughts/feelings.

**Examples**:  
- 你愿意吗？(nǐ yuàn yì ma?) - Are you willing?  
- 我愿意帮助你。(wǒ yuàn yì bāng zhù nǐ) - I am willing to help you.  
- 她不愿意去。(tā bù yuàn yì qù) - She is not willing to go.

**Usage Notes**:  
愿意 (yuàn yì) is often followed by verbs (e.g. 做 (zuò), 去 (qù)) to indicate readiness/consent. Common in formal and informal contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: “愿 (yuàn) (heart) + 意 (yì) (idea)” = "heart willing, mind agrees"-so you are willing!
