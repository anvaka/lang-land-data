# **树 (shù) - Tree**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 树 (shù): Left side is 木 (mù)-"wood" or "tree" radical, indicating relation to something wooden or plant-related. Right side is 对 (duì) without the rightmost stroke (寸, cùn), acting as the phonetic component.

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢大树。(Wǒ xǐhuān dà shù.) - I like big trees.  
- 公园里有很多树。(Gōngyuán lǐ yǒu hěn duō shù.) - There are many trees in the park.  
- 小鸟在树上唱歌。(Xiǎo niǎo zài shù shàng chànggē.) - The little bird sings on the tree.

**Usage Notes**:  
树 (shù) is a noun referring to any type of tree. Often used with measure word 棵 (kē).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 木 (mù) on the left as the "wood" or "tree" base; the right part 对 (duì) hints at the sound. Imagine a tree (木, mù) standing next to a marker (寸, cùn) to "correctly" (对, duì) measure its growth.
