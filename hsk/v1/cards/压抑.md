# **压抑 (yā yì) - Suppress; Constrain**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **压 (yā)**: "to press, to push down." Radical is 厂 (hǎn, "cliff," at top) + ⼁ (vertical stroke, underneath), conveys pressing down from above.  
- **抑 (yì)**: "to restrain, suppress." 扌 (shǒu, "hand," on left) + 卩 (jié, "seal," on right), suggests suppressing with a hand.

**Examples**:  
- 他感到很压抑。(Tā gǎndào hěn yāyì.) - He feels very repressed.  
- 不要压抑自己的感情。(Bùyào yāyì zìjǐ de gǎnqíng.) - Don’t suppress your feelings.  
- 这里的气氛很压抑。(Zhèlǐ de qìfēn hěn yāyì.) - The atmosphere here is oppressive.

**Usage Notes**:  
压抑 (yāyì) is often used for emotions or atmosphere, not for physical objects. Can be both a verb and adjective.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine a hand (扌, shǒu) pressing (压, yā) down and sealing (卩, jié) something inside: to suppress or hold down emotions.
