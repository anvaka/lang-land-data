# **复杂 (fùzá) - Complex / Complicated**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **复 (fù)**: Top: “夂” (zhǐ, go) and inside: “日” (rì, sun) - originally means “to repeat” or “again.”  
- **杂 (zá)**: Top: “九” (jiǔ, nine) and bottom: “木” (mù, wood) - means “mixed” or “various.”

**Examples**:  
- 这个问题很复杂。(Zhège wèntí hěn fùzá.) - This problem is very complicated.  
- 复杂的情况让人头疼。(Fùzá de qíngkuàng ràng rén tóuténg.) - Complicated situations give people headaches.  
- 他的解释太复杂了。(Tā de jiěshì tài fùzá le.) - His explanation is too complex.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 复杂 (fùzá) is mainly used to describe situations, issues, structures, or emotions-not people’s personalities.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 复 (fù, repeat) + 杂 (zá, mix) = “repeatedly mixed” = complicated or complex.  
- Imagine a situation that repeats and mixes up, making things less simple!
