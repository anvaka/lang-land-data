# **冷 (lěng) - cold**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 冷 (lěng):
  - Radical: 冫(bīng, "ice", on the left-coldness)
  - Component: 令 (lìng, "command/order", on the right-pronunciation clue)
  - The "ice" radical (冫) signals a connection to cold or freezing.

**Examples**:  
- 今天很冷。(Jīntiān hěn lěng.) - Today is very cold.  
- 水变冷了。(Shuǐ biàn lěng le.) - The water has become cold.  
- 你怕冷吗？(Nǐ pà lěng ma?) - Are you afraid of the cold?

**Usage Notes**:  
- 冷 (lěng) describes low temperature for weather, things, or even feelings (e.g., 冷空气 (lěng kōngqì) - cold air, 冷饮 (lěng yǐn) - cold drink, 冷漠 (lěng mò) - indifferent).  
- Often used with 很 (hěn, "very") to intensify.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 冷 (lěng): The "ice" radical (冫) means it's about cold, and 令 (lìng) sounds similar to "lěng". Imagine an "order" (令 lìng) to bring ice (冫 bīng) everywhere-everything becomes cold!
