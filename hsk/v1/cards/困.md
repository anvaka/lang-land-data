# **困 (kùn) - Sleepy; tired; trapped**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 困 (kùn): Left-right structure. Outer enclosure 囗 (wéi) means "enclosure" (outside); 内 (nèi) inside, here simplified as 木 (mù), "tree" (inside). The meaning is something enclosed/trapped.

**Examples**:  
- 我很困。(Wǒ hěn kùn.) - I am very sleepy.  
- 她被困在房间里。(Tā bèi kùn zài fángjiān lǐ.) - She is trapped in the room.  
- 上课时不要困。(Shàngkè shí bú yào kùn.) - Don't get sleepy in class.

**Usage Notes**:  
困 (kùn) can mean "sleepy/tired" (most common in daily use) or "trapped/stuck" (in a situation or place), depending on context.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine a "tree" (木 mù) stuck "inside an enclosure" (囗 wéi)-it can't get out, so it's tired or trapped!
