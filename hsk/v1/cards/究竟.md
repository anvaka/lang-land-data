# **究竟 (jiūjìng) - after all; exactly; actually**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **究 (jiū)**:
  - Radical: 穴 (xué, cave/roof) on top, 九 (jiǔ, nine) at the bottom.
  - Meaning: to investigate, study deeply.  
- **竟 (jìng)**:
  - Radical: 音 (yīn, sound) on top, 儿 (ér, child) at the bottom.
  - Meaning: finally, at last, after all.

**Examples**:  
- 你 (nǐ) 究竟 (jiūjìng) 想 (xiǎng) 要 (yào) 什么 (shénme)？(What exactly do you want?)  
- 他 (tā) 究竟 (jiūjìng) 去 (qù) 了 (le) 哪里 (nǎlǐ)？(Where did he go after all?)  
- 这 (zhè) 些 (xiē) 事情 (shìqíng) 究竟 (jiūjìng) 是 (shì) 怎么 (zěnme) 发生 (fāshēng) 的 (de)？(How exactly did these things happen?)

**Usage Notes**:  
- Used in questions for emphasis or when seeking a definite answer.  
- Can appear before the verb or subject.  
- Formal, but used in both spoken and written Chinese.

**Memory Aids**:  
- **究 (jiū)** = "dig deep"; **竟 (jìng)** = "come to an end": When you "dig deep until the end," you want to know what it actually is-究竟 (jiūjìng)!
