# **美观 (měi guān) - Attractive; Pleasing to the eye**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 美 (měi): "beautiful." Top: 羊 (yáng, sheep) - symbol of beauty; bottom: 大 (dà, big).  
- 观 (guān): "view, observe." Left: 见 (jiàn, to see); right/top: 又 (yòu, again/hand).

**Examples**:

- 美观和实用同样重要。(Měi guān hé shí yòng tóng yàng zhòng yào.) - Appearance and practicality are equally important.

**Usage Notes**:  
美观 (měi guān) is often used to describe appearances of things (e.g., objects, designs), not people directly. Common phrase: 美观大方 (měi guān dà fāng, stylish and tasteful).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: 美 (měi, beautiful) + 观 (guān, to observe) = "looks beautiful when viewed."  
Imagine a "sheep" (羊 yáng) that is "big" (大 dà) is considered beautiful; when you "see" (见 jiàn) it, it’s pleasing to your "eyes."
