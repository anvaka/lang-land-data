**Character Breakdown**:  
- **前 (qián)**: "front," "before." Left: "刂 (dāo)" radical (knife) on the right, "舟 (zhōu)" (boat) on the top/left. Suggests "moving ahead in a boat."  
- **面 (miàn)**: "face," "surface." Top: "囗 (wéi)" enclosure; inside: "面 (miàn)" (face/side). Indicates a side, face, or plane.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **前面 (qiánmian)** is a location word used after a noun, similar to "in front of." Can also be used as a standalone noun ("the front").  
- For directions, pair with 在 (zài) for "at/in front of."

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think of "前 (qián)" as advancing forward; "面 (miàn)" as a face-so "front face" = "in front."  
- "面 (miàn)" is common in location words (e.g., 上面 (shàngmian) - above).
