# **熨 (yùn) - to iron; to press (clothes)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **熨 (yùn)**: Left side is 火 (huǒ, "fire") radical (left), indicating heat; right is 彖 (tuàn, "piglet"/phonetic), suggesting pronunciation. The character as a whole relates to using heat (fire) to flatten or smooth items.

**Examples**:  
- 她在熨衣服。(Tā zài yùn yīfu.) - She is ironing clothes.  
- 这件衬衫需要熨一下。(Zhè jiàn chènshān xūyào yùn yíxià.) - This shirt needs to be ironed.  
- 你会用熨斗吗？(Nǐ huì yòng yùndǒu ma?) - Do you know how to use an iron?

**Usage Notes**:  
- **熨 (yùn)** is most often used with **衣服 (yīfu, clothes)** and **熨斗 (yùndǒu, iron [appliance])**.  
- Can also mean “to smooth or soothe” in a figurative sense, but primarily refers to ironing clothes.

**Memory Aids**:  
- The 火 (huǒ, fire) radical on the left = heat. Imagine smoothing clothes with fire = **熨 (yùn)** (iron).  
- "Yùn" sounds like “iron” in a robotic accent-think of yourself ordering a robot: "Yùn, iron the shirt!"
