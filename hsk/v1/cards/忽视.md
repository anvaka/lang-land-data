# **忽视 (hū shì) - Ignore / Neglect**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **忽 (hū)**: Top is 勹 (bāo, "wrap" radical), inside is 小 (xiǎo, "small"), bottom has 心 (xīn, "heart"). Means "sudden" or "neglect"-suggests overlooking with the heart.  
- **视 (shì)**: Left is 见 (jiàn, "see"), right is 示 (shì, "to show"). Means "to look" or "to regard."

**Examples**:  
- 不要忽视 (bù yào hū shì) 小问题 (xiǎo wèntí) - (Don’t ignore small problems.)  
- 他的建议 (tā de jiànyì) 被 (bèi) 忽视 (hū shì) 了 (le) - (His advice was ignored.)  
- 健康 (jiànkāng) 不 (bù) 能 (néng) 被 (bèi) 忽视 (hū shì) - (Health cannot be neglected.)

**Usage Notes**:  
忽视 (hū shì) is often used for intangible things (opinions, feelings, health). Formal or written tone. Can take an object.

**Memory Aids**:  
忽 (hū) has 心 (xīn, "heart")-if you ignore something, your heart isn’t paying attention. 视 (shì) is to "see," so 忽视 (hū shì) = "to see with a neglected heart."
