# **严厉 (yán lì) - Strict; Stern**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **严 (yán)**: means "strict; severe." Top: "⺊" roof-like radical, suggests shelter/cover. Bottom: "口 (kǒu)" mouth, suggesting speech or command.  
- **厉 (lì)**: means "severe; strict." Left: "厂 (chǎng)" cliff radical (left/top), suggests harshness. Right: "万 (wàn)" or "力 (lì)", strength or power, indicating force.

**Examples**:  
- 老师 (lǎo shī) 很严厉 (hěn yán lì)。- The teacher is very strict.  
- 父母 (fù mǔ) 对 (duì) 他 (tā) 很严厉 (hěn yán lì)。- His parents are strict with him.  
- 他 (tā) 受到 (shòu dào) 严厉 (yán lì) 的 (de) 批评 (pī píng)。- He received stern criticism.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **严厉 (yán lì)** is often used to describe people (teachers, parents) or actions (punishments, criticism) that are strict, firm, or harsh.  
- Used in both spoken and formal written contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think: A "roof (⺊)" keeping things "strict (严, yán)" and a "cliff (厂, chǎng)" showing "severe (厉, lì)" consequences. Strict people keep you 'under their roof' and 'on the edge'!
