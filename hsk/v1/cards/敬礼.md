# **敬礼 (jìng lǐ) - Salute / Pay respects**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **敬 (jìng)**: "Respect." The left side (top to bottom), "艹 (cǎo)" radical (grass), commonly hints at plants or show; the right side combines "苟 (gǒu)" components, contributing to the sense of seriousness or formality.  
- **礼 (lǐ)**: "Ritual; ceremony." Left is "礻(shì)" radical (altar/spirit), related to rites; right is "丰 (fēng)" (abundance), symbolizing order and decorum.

**Examples**:  
- 他向国旗敬礼。(Tā xiàng guóqí jìnglǐ.) - He salutes the national flag.  
- 学生们在升旗时敬礼。(Xuéshēngmen zài shēngqí shí jìnglǐ.) - The students salute during the flag-raising.  
- 请你向老师敬礼。(Qǐng nǐ xiàng lǎoshī jìnglǐ.) - Please salute the teacher.

**Usage Notes**:  
敬礼 (jìnglǐ) is often used for formal or military salutes, but also in general contexts of showing respect physically, e.g., bowing. Usually follows 向 (xiàng) + person/thing + 敬礼 (jìnglǐ).

**Memory Aids**:  
"敬 (jìng)" looks complicated, like a respectful posture; "礼 (lǐ)" starts with 礻(shì)-think of rituals. Together, imagine giving a respectful bow at a ceremony.
