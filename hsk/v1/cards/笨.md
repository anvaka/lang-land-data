# **笨 (bèn) - stupid; clumsy**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **笨** (bèn): Top: "⺮" (zhú) bamboo radical; Bottom: "本" (běn) meaning "root, origin". Bamboo + root = "笨" (bèn), resembling something thick rather than nimble-hence, clumsy or foolish.

**Examples**:  
- 他很笨。(Tā hěn bèn.) - He is very clumsy/stupid.  
- 我觉得自己有点笨。(Wǒ juéde zìjǐ yǒudiǎn bèn.) - I think I am a bit dull.  
- 这方法太笨了。(Zhè fāngfǎ tài bèn le.) - This method is too clumsy.

**Usage Notes**:  
- "笨" (bèn) can describe both intelligence (stupid) and physical movement (clumsy).  
- Not as harsh as "傻" (shǎ), but still negative. Use cautiously.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a bamboo (⺮, zhú) tree with roots (本, běn) that are heavy and tangled-hard to move, so it’s "笨" (bèn), meaning clumsy.
