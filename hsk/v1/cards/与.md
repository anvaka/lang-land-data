# **与 (yǔ) - with; and; to**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 与 (yǔ): Top part resembles a hand; the bottom suggests connection. Traditionally means "give" or "together with".

**Examples**:  
- 我(yǒu)与(yǔ)你(nǐ)一起(yīqǐ)学习(xuéxí)。 (Wǒ yǔ nǐ yīqǐ xuéxí.) - I study together with you.  
- 他(tā)与(yǔ)朋友(péngyǒu)聊天(liáotiān)。 (Tā yǔ péngyǒu liáotiān.) - He chats with friends.  
- 与(yǔ)其(qí)等待(děngdài)，不如(bùrú)努力(nǔlì)。 (Yǔqí děngdài, bùrú nǔlì.) - Rather than wait, better to work hard.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 与(yǔ) is formal; often used in writing. In speech, 和(hé) or 跟(gēn) is more common for "and/with".  
- Functions as a preposition ("with"), conjunction ("and"), or verb ("to give" in classical Chinese).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think: "A hand" (top of 与(yǔ)) "giving" or "connecting"-so 与(yǔ) means "together with".  
- Visual: The lines connect, just like people connect "with" each other.
