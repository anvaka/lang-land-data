# **迟钝 (chí dùn) - Slow-witted; sluggish; dull (in response or movement)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **迟** (chí): "Late, slow." Left: 辶 (chuò, "movement/walk") radical, indicating motion. Right: 尺 (chǐ, "ruler/measure"), hints at measurement of time-being "late."  
- **钝** (dùn): "Blunt, not sharp, obtuse." Left: 钅(jīn, "metal") radical, usually relates to metals/tools. Right: 屯 (tún, "to station, squat"), suggesting heaviness or dullness.

**Examples**:  
- 他的反应很迟钝。(Tā de fǎnyìng hěn chí dùn.) - His reactions are very slow.  
- 思维迟钝影响了学习。(Sīwéi chí dùn yǐngxiǎngle xuéxí.) - Sluggish thinking affected learning.  
- 这把刀变迟钝了。(Zhè bǎ dāo biàn chí dùn le.) - This knife has become dull.

**Usage Notes**:  
"迟钝" (chí dùn) can describe both literal (tools: "dull knife") and figurative (people: "slow to understand or react") sluggishness. Often used with verbs like "反应" (fǎnyìng, "react"), "思维" (sīwéi, "thinking").

**Memory Aids**:  
Think "迟" (chí) as "late" and "钝" (dùn) as "dull"-someone who is always "late" for sharp responses is "迟钝" (chí dùn), slow or not sharp!
