**Character Breakdown**:  
- **距 (jù)**: Left = 足 (zú, "foot") radical (bottom); Right = 巨 (jù, "huge"). Suggests a big step, relating to distance.  
- **离 (lí)**: Left = 离 (lí, phonetic, bird radical inside); Right = 隹 (zhuī, "short-tailed bird"). Implies separation or being apart.

**Examples**:  
- 我们之间的距离很远。(Wǒmen zhījiān de jùlí hěn yuǎn.) - The distance between us is far.

**Usage Notes**:  
**距离 (jùlí)** can function as both a noun ("distance") and a verb ("to be away from"). Common in both physical and abstract contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of **距 (jù)** with a "foot" taking a big step, and **离 (lí)** as two birds flying apart-together they indicate separation or space.
