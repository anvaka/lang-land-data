# **生长 (shēng zhǎng) - to grow; to grow up**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **生** (shēng): "to give birth; to grow; life." The top is **艹** (cǎo, grass radical), representing plants; bottom is **土** (tǔ, soil/earth), symbolizing growth from soil.  
- **长** (zhǎng): "to grow; to develop; chief." The **长** (zhǎng) character looks like a person growing taller.

**Examples**:  
- 植物生长得很快。(Zhíwù shēngzhǎng de hěn kuài.) - The plant grows very quickly.  
- 孩子正在生长。(Háizi zhèngzài shēngzhǎng.) - The child is growing.  
- 阳光有助于生长。(Yángguāng yǒuzhù yú shēngzhǎng.) - Sunlight helps growth.

**Usage Notes**:  
**生长** (shēngzhǎng) is formal and used for living things (plants, people), often in scientific or descriptive contexts. Use **长大** (zhǎng dà, to grow up) for personal growth, especially for children.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine a plant (**生** shēng) rising up from the earth, and a child getting taller (**长** zhǎng) with the sun above. Both suggest "to grow."
