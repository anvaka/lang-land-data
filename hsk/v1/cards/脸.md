# **脸 (liǎn) - face**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 脸 (liǎn):
  - Left: 月 (yuè) - the "flesh" radical, referring to the body
  - Right: 佥 (qiān) - phonetic component, sometimes associated with "all" or "together"

**Examples**:  
- 她的脸很漂亮。(Tā de liǎn hěn piàoliang.) - Her face is very pretty.  
- 孩子脸上有笑容。(Háizi liǎn shàng yǒu xiàoróng.) - The child has a smile on his face.  
- 他低下了脸。(Tā dī xiàle liǎn.) - He lowered his face.

**Usage Notes**:  
脸 (liǎn) is a noun used for the physical face and also metaphorically (e.g., "lose face" - 丢脸 diū liǎn). Placed before 上 (shàng) to mean "on (the) face."

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of the left radical 月 (yuè), "flesh," as body-related, and the face is a part of your flesh/body. The right side helps recall pronunciation "liǎn."
