# **空洞 (kōng dòng) - Hollow; empty (often figurative); cavity**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **空** (kōng): "Empty, void." Top: "穴" (xué, cave/roof radical), suggests enclosure/space. Bottom: "工" (gōng, work) indicating structure.  
- **洞** (dòng): "Hole, cave, cavity." Left: "氵" (shuǐ, water radical) showing relation to water/flow. Right: "同" (tóng, same, together) within the water radical, indicating an opening or space.

**Examples**:  
- 这个理论很空洞 (zhè ge lǐ lùn hěn kōng dòng) - This theory is very hollow.  
- 牆上有一个空洞 (qiáng shàng yǒu yí gè kōng dòng) - There's a cavity in the wall.  
- 他的承诺听起来很空洞 (tā de chéng nuò tīng qǐ lái hěn kōng dòng) - His promises sound empty.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **空洞** (kōng dòng) is often used figuratively to describe something lacking substance (e.g. words/ideas).  
- As a noun, it refers to a physical hole/cavity.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine an "empty (空 kōng)" "hole/cave (洞 dòng)"-together: a hollow space or words with no "substance inside."
