# **米 (mǐ) - Rice; meter**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 米 (mǐ): Represents "rice" (usually uncooked grains) and "meter" (the unit of length).  
- Structure: The top part resembles grains of rice. The character consists of a cross (十 shí) with small "dots" representing scattered rice grains.

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢吃米饭。(Wǒ xǐhuān chī mǐfàn.) - I like to eat rice.  
- 一米长的绳子。(Yī mǐ cháng de shéngzi.) - A one-meter-long rope.  
- 中国人常吃米。(Zhōngguó rén cháng chī mǐ.) - Chinese people often eat rice.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 米 (mǐ) alone usually means uncooked rice or the metric "meter."

- As a measurement, 米 (mǐ) is often seen in math or science.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine the character 米 (mǐ) as scattered rice grains on a table.  
- "米 (mǐ)" sounds a bit like "me," so imagine saying, "ME like rice!"
