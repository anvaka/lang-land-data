# **舱 (cāng) - Cabin; Compartment**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 舱 (cāng):
  - Radical: ⻍ (fǎn chuán, simplified 舟 zhōu, "boat") on the left, representing "boat/ship".
  - Right: 仓 (cāng), meaning “granary” or “storehouse”.
  - Overall: Suggests a boat compartment or an enclosed space inside a vessel.

**Examples**:  
- 飞机舱 (fēi jī cāng) - Airplane cabin  
- 头等舱 (tóu děng cāng) - First-class cabin  
- 船舱里很安静。 (chuán cāng lǐ hěn ān jìng) - It is very quiet inside the ship’s cabin.

**Usage Notes**:  
舱 (cāng) is used for enclosed compartments in vehicles, especially ships and airplanes, not for rooms in buildings. Commonly appears as a suffix (e.g., 行李舱 xíng lǐ cāng "luggage compartment").

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine the 舟 (zhōu, "boat") radical on the left as a ship, and 仓 (cāng, "storehouse") as a room inside it-a "cabin" is a room inside a ship.
