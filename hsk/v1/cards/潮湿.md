# **潮湿 (cháo shī) - Damp; Humid**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 潮 (cháo):
  - Left: 氵(shuǐ) “water” radical; right: 朝(zhāo/cháo) “morning/dynasty.”
  - Means “tide” or “damp.” Water radical hints at moisture.  
- 湿 (shī):
  - Left: 氵(shuǐ) “water” radical; right: 显(xiǎn) component (with 日(rì) “sun” on top, below parts indicate “manifest/appear”).
  - Means “wet,” “moist.”

**Examples**:  
- 空气很潮湿。(Kōngqì hěn cháo shī.) - The air is very humid.  
- 房间里太潮湿了。(Fángjiān lǐ tài cháo shī le.) - The room is too damp.

**Usage Notes**:  
潮湿(cháo shī) is commonly used to describe weather, rooms, or environments. Usually appears as an adjective.

**Memory Aids**:  
Both 潮(cháo) and 湿(shī) have the “three drops of water” (氵(shuǐ)) radical, making them easy to connect with moisture. Think: “Where there’s water (氵(shuǐ)), there’s 潮湿(cháo shī)!”
