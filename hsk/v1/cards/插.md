# **插 (chā) - to insert, to stick in**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 插 (chā): Left side is 扌(shǒu, hand radical) indicating actions done with the hand; right side is 叉(chā, fork) suggesting "forking" or dividing, which connects to the idea of pushing something between other things. 扌(shǒu) is on the left; 叉(chā) is on the right.

**Examples**:  
- 请插(chā)卡(kǎ)。 (Qǐng chā kǎ.) - Please insert the card.  
- 他(tā)把(bǎ)花(huā)插(chā)在(zài)瓶(píng)里(lǐ)。 (Tā bǎ huā chā zài píng lǐ.) - He put the flowers into the vase.  
- 不(bù)要(yào)随便(suíbiàn)插(chā)话(huà)。 (Bù yào suíbiàn chā huà.) - Don’t interrupt (literally: insert a remark) arbitrarily.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 插(chā) is mainly used for physically inserting objects (插卡(chā kǎ), 插头(chā tóu, plug)), and figuratively for interruptions (插班(chā bān, transfer into a class), 插话(chā huà, to interrupt speech)).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think: hand (扌shǒu) + fork (叉chā) = use your hand to push or stick in like a fork.  
- "Insert" the fork (叉chā) with your hand (扌shǒu)!
