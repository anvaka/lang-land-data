**Usage Notes**:  
**缺口** (quē kǒu) refers to a literal opening or breach in a physical object, or metaphorically to a shortage/deficit (e.g., financial shortfall or skills gap).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of **缺** (quē) as "missing" and **口** (kǒu) as "mouth/opening"-so **缺口** (quē kǒu) is a "missing opening," i.e., a gap!
