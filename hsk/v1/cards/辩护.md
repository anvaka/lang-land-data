# **辩护 (biànhù) - Defend/Defense (in speech or legal contexts)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 辩 (biàn): "Argue, debate." Radical 言 (yán, "speech") on the left, meaning "words/speech," + 辛 (xīn, "bitter/hardship") on the right, suggesting effort in speaking or reasoning.  
- 护 (hù): "Protect, guard." Radical 扌 (shǒu, "hand") on the left, meaning "hand/action," + 户 (hù, "household/door") on the right, implying protecting like guarding a door.

**Examples**:  
- 律师(lǜshī)为(wèi)他(tā)辩护(biànhù)。 (Lǜshī wèi tā biànhù.) - The lawyer defended him.  
- 他(tā)自己(zìjǐ)辩护(biànhù)说(shuō)他(tā)无罪(wúzuì)。 (Tā zìjǐ biànhù shuō tā wúzuì.) - He defended himself, saying he was innocent.  
- 你(nǐ)能(néng)为(wèi)我(wǒ)辩护(biànhù)吗(ma)？ (Nǐ néng wèi wǒ biànhù ma?) - Can you defend me?

**Usage Notes**:  
辩护 (biànhù) is often used in legal or formal contexts, especially for defending someone’s actions, rights, or reputation. Usually followed by the person/object being defended (为(wèi) + [person/object] + 辩护(biànhù)).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 辩(biàn) as "speaking with difficulty" (speech + hardship), and 护(hù) as "protecting with your hand at the door." So 辩护(biànhù) is "defending/protecting with words."
