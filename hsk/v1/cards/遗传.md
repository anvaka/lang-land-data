# **遗传 (yíchuán) - Inherit; Heredity**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 遗 (yí): Left-辶 (chuò) "movement," Right-贵 (guì, rare form for "valuable"); refers to something left behind, passing on.  
- 传 (chuán): Left-亻 (rén) "person," Right-专 (zhuān, "focus/special"); related to spreading or transmitting.

**Examples**:  
- 这个疾病是遗传的。 (Zhège jíbìng shì yíchuán de.) - This disease is hereditary.  
- 他遗传了妈妈的眼睛。 (Tā yíchuánle māmā de yǎnjīng.) - He inherited his mother’s eyes.  
- 基因通过遗传传递。 (Jīyīn tōngguò yíchuán chuándì.) - Genes are passed on through heredity.

**Usage Notes**:  
遗传 (yíchuán) is often used in scientific or medical contexts. Can be both noun ("heredity") and verb ("to inherit genetically"), but not for material inheritance.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 遗 (yí) as "leaving" something (like a legacy)，and 传 (chuán) as "passing it on"-so 遗传 (yíchuán) is leaving something behind and passing it to the next generation.
