# **支 (zhī) - branch; measure word for stick-like things**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **支** (zhī): Top-“十” (shí, ten); Bottom-“又” (yòu, again/hand). The structure suggests holding or supporting, like a branch (supporting something from the main trunk).

**Examples**:  
- 我买了一支笔。(Wǒ mǎi le yī zhī bǐ.) - I bought a pen.  
- 那支队伍赢了比赛。(Nà zhī duìwǔ yíng le bǐsài.) - That team won the game.  
- 请给我一支花。(Qǐng gěi wǒ yī zhī huā.) - Please give me a flower (single stem).

**Usage Notes**:  
- **支** (zhī) is a measure word for long, thin, inflexible objects (pens, rifles, flowers, teams).  
- Also means "branch" (of a tree) or "to support".

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine your hand (**又** yòu) holding up a stick (**十** shí) = **支** (zhī), something supported or sticking out.  
- **支** (zhī) sounds like "zhee", as in supporting a "thing-y".
