# **拐弯 (guǎi wān) - to turn (a corner), to make a turn**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **拐** (guǎi): Left side is "扌(shǒu)" (hand) radical, meaning action by hand; right side is "卦(guà)" (divination, used here for sound); overall means to turn, to bend.  
- **弯** (wān): Top is "弓(gōng)" (bow), bottom/right "䂓(wān)" (phonetic), gives sense of something curved or bent.

**Examples**:  
- 请在前面拐弯。(Qǐng zài qiánmiàn guǎi wān.) - Please turn ahead.  
- 过了红绿灯就拐弯。(Guò le hónglǜdēng jiù guǎi wān.) - Turn after the traffic light.  
- 他不喜欢拐弯抹角地说话。(Tā bù xǐhuān guǎi wān mò jiǎo de shuōhuà.) - He doesn’t like to speak indirectly.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **拐弯** (guǎi wān) can be literal (turning physically) or figurative (speaking indirectly, as in idiom **拐弯抹角** (guǎi wān mò jiǎo)).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine your hand (**扌(shǒu)** in **拐(guǎi)**) pushing something to make it curve, like bending a bow (**弓(gōng)** in **弯(wān)**) to turn around a corner.
