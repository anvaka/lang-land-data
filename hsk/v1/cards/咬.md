# **咬 (yǎo) - to bite**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **咬** (yǎo): Left side is the "mouth" radical **口** (kǒu) indicating actions related to the mouth. Right side is **交** (jiāo), suggesting a link with "to intersect" or "exchange," complementing the mouth action. Thus, together, describes the mouth engaging or sinking into something.

**Examples**:  
- **狗咬人** (gǒu yǎo rén) - The dog bites people.  
- **别咬我的手** (bié yǎo wǒ de shǒu) - Don’t bite my hand.  
- **她咬了一口苹果** (tā yǎo le yì kǒu píngguǒ) - She took a bite of the apple.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **咬** (yǎo) is usually a physical action involving the mouth and teeth, literal or figurative (e.g., **咬牙坚持** (yǎo yá jiānchí) - to grit one’s teeth and persevere).  
- Often used for people, animals, or things that can "bite."

**Memory Aids**:  
- Picture your **口** (kǒu) (mouth, left side) crossing (like **交** (jiāo), right side) into food - that's how you "bite" (**咬** (yǎo))!
