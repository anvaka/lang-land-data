# **租 (zū) - to rent; to lease**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **租 (zū)**: Left: 禾 (hé) "grain" (rice plant radical), indicating agriculture/trade; Right: 且 (qiě), a phonetic component. Together, "trade of grain," relating to collecting rent.

**Examples**:  
- 我想租(zū)一套房子。(Wǒ xiǎng zū yí tào fángzi.) - I want to rent an apartment.  
- 你可以把车租(zū)给我吗？(Nǐ kěyǐ bǎ chē zū gěi wǒ ma?) - Can you rent me the car?  
- 这家店出租(zū)自行车。(Zhè jiā diàn chūzū zìxíngchē.) - This shop rents out bicycles.

**Usage Notes**:  
Use 租(zū) for both renting in (as a tenant) and renting out depending on subject. Often used with 给(gěi) for renting to someone, or with 出租(chūzū) for renting out.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine renting grain (禾(hé))-in ancient days, people paid rent with crops. "租(zū)" contains "grain," so it's about trading for temporary use.
