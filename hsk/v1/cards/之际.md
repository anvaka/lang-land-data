# **之际 (zhī jì) - At the time of; on the occasion of**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **之** (zhī): Classical possessive particle; “of.” Composed of 丶 (zhǔ) "dot" on top, 下 (xià) "below," forming a bottom-heavy structure.  
- **际** (jì): Border, occasion; “edge, boundary.” Left: 阝(fù) "mound" radical, signifying place/area; Right: 祭 (jì), meaning “to offer sacrifices,” hinting at ritual occasions.

**Examples**:  
- 在毕业之际 (zài bì yè zhī jì) - At the time of graduation  
- 离别之际 (lí bié zhī jì) - At the moment of parting  
- 新年之际 (xīn nián zhī jì) - On the occasion of New Year

**Usage Notes**:  
- **之际** (zhī jì) is formal/literary and attaches to nouns/events to mark a significant timepoint. Similar to "during" or "at the time of" in English.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Picture **之** (zhī) as a "path of" and **际** (jì) as the "edge," so **之际** (zhī jì) is "at the edge/time of" an event.
