# **条理 (tiáo lǐ) - Order; Coherence**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 条 (tiáo): Strip; item; measure word for long, thin objects. Top is “夂” (zhǐ， "go slowly"), bottom is “木” (mù, “wood”).
- 理 (lǐ): "Reason; logic." Left is “王” (wáng, king/jade/ruler), right is “里” (lǐ, village/within), indicating an organized system or principle.

**Examples**:  
- 说话要有条理。(shuō huà yào yǒu tiáo lǐ.) - One must speak with order/coherence.  
- 她做事很有条理。(tā zuò shì hěn yǒu tiáo lǐ.) - She does things very systematically.  
- 文章缺乏条理。(wén zhāng quē fá tiáo lǐ.) - The article lacks structure/coherence.

**Usage Notes**:  
条理 (tiáo lǐ) is often used with 有 (yǒu, have) or 无 (wú, lack) to comment on someone's organization, thought process, or the structure of speech/writing.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 条 (tiáo) as threads and 理 (lǐ) as the logic that arranges them-条理 (tiáo lǐ) means threading things together in an orderly, logical way.
