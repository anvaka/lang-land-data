# **事情 (shìqíng) - Thing; matter; affair**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 事 (shì): means "matter", "affair", or "event". Radical: 亅 (jué, hook) at the bottom; 上 (shàng, up/top) component at the top.  
- 情 (qíng): means "feeling", "situation", or "condition". Left: 忄 (xīn, heart radical); right: 青 (qīng, blue/green/clear).

**Examples**:  
- 这件事情很重要。(Zhè jiàn shìqíng hěn zhòngyào.) - This matter is very important.  
- 你有什么事情吗？(Nǐ yǒu shénme shìqíng ma?) - Do you have something (to talk about)?  
- 他忘了那件事情。(Tā wàng le nà jiàn shìqíng.) - He forgot about that thing.

**Usage Notes**:  
事情 (shìqíng) is used for concrete or abstract "things" or "affairs"-not physical objects. Often used with measure word 件 (jiàn).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: 事 (shì) = event + 情 (qíng) = feeling → "an affair that has feelings attached: a matter or thing".
