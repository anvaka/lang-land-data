# **冰激凌 (bīng jī líng) - ice cream**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 冰 (bīng): "ice." Radical: 冫 (bīng, ice) on the left, shows it's related to cold/frozen.  
- 激 (jī): "stimulate; surge." Left: 氵(shuǐ, water, left side), right: 敫 (jiǎo), related to “strike.”  
- 凌 (líng): "soar," "ice," "approach." Top: 冫(bīng, ice), bottom: 夌 (líng, to approach).

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢吃冰激凌。(Wǒ xǐhuān chī bīng jī líng.) - I like to eat ice cream.  
- 你想要什么口味的冰激凌？(Nǐ xiǎng yào shénme kǒuwèi de bīng jī líng?) - What flavor of ice cream do you want?  
- 冰激凌很容易融化。(Bīng jī líng hěn róngyì rónghuà.) - Ice cream melts easily.

**Usage Notes**:  
冰激凌 (bīng jī líng) is most commonly used in northern China; 冰淇淋 (bīng qí lín) is preferred in southern China. Both mean "ice cream."

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine 冰 (bīng, ice) on both sides-because ice cream is super cold! 激 (jī) is like water splashing, and 凌 (líng) with ice on top is the frozen treat.
