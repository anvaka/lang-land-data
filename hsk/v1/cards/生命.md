# **生命 (shēng mìng) - life**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 生 (shēng): "to live," "to be born." Top: "grass" radical (⺾), bottom: "earth" (土 tǔ) component, suggesting new life sprouting from the ground.  
- 命 (mìng): "fate," "life." Top: "command" radical (令 lìng), bottom: "mouth" (口 kǒu). Suggests "orders given by mouth"-thus, by extension, "destiny" or "life given."

**Examples**:  
- 生命(shēng mìng)非常宝贵。(shēng mìng fēi cháng bǎo guì.) - Life is very precious.  
- 每个生命(měi gè shēng mìng)都值得尊重。(měi gè shēng mìng dōu zhí dé zūn zhòng.) - Every life deserves respect.  
- 动物也有生命(dòng wù yě yǒu shēng mìng)。(dòng wù yě yǒu shēng mìng.) - Animals also have life.

**Usage Notes**:  
生命(shēng mìng) refers to the concept or state of being alive (biological existence), not just an individual's life story. For "one’s life" or "lifetime," use 生活(shēng huó) or 人生(rén shēng).

**Memory Aids**:  
Picture "生(shēng)" as a plant growing-representing life, and "命(mìng)" as a mouth issuing an order-like life being granted. Life (生命 shēng mìng) is both given and blossoming.
