# **杀 (shā) - to kill; to murder**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 杀 (shā): The left side is the radical “⺉” (knife, dāo) indicating action often related to cutting or weapons (left). The right side “杀” (shā) historically includes “木” (wood, mù) and “⺁” (cliff, yǎn) above, suggesting forceful action (top). The entire character implies violence involving a blade.

**Examples**:  
- 他杀了一个人。(Tā shā le yī gè rén.) - He killed a person.  
- 禁止杀动物。(Jìnzhǐ shā dòngwù.) - Killing animals is forbidden.  
- 杀时间很容易。(Shā shíjiān hěn róngyì.) - Killing time is easy.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 杀 (shā) acts as a verb: usually means to kill, but can also be figurative, as in 杀时间 (shā shíjiān, to kill time).  
- Used in legal, historical, and everyday contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine the “knife” radical (⺉, dāo) on the left representing the weapon used to “kill” (shā).  
- Think: “SHA!”-a sharp sound, like a sudden attack.
