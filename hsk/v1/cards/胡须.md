# **胡须 (hú xū) - Beard; mustache**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **胡 (hú)**: "Beard" or "reckless." Radical: 月 (yuè, "moon/flesh") on the left. The right side resembles 古 (gǔ, "ancient").  
- **须 (xū)**: "Mustache; beard." Top: 彡 (shān, "hair" strokes). Bottom: 页 (yè, "page/head").

**Examples**:  
- 他的胡须 (tā de hú xū) 很长 (hěn cháng)。- His beard is long.  
- 他留胡须 (tā liú hú xū)。- He grows a beard.  
- 胡须 (hú xū) 变白了 (biàn bái le)。- His beard turned white.

**Usage Notes**:  
胡须 (hú xū) refers to all facial hair (beard & mustache). Use specifically for men; not for animal whiskers (use 胡子 (hú zi) for a colloquial "beard").

**Memory Aids**:  
胡 (hú): Imagine “moon/flesh” means "face," “ancient” for wisdom (old men have beards).  
须 (xū): 彡 (shān) looks like hair, 页 (yè) like a face or head-hair on the face.
