# **通用 (tōngyòng) - Universal; General; In common use**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **通 (tōng)**: “to go through, to connect.” Left: 辶 (chuò) "movement/road" radical; right: 甬 (yǒng) "to pass through."  
- **用 (yòng)**: “to use.” Top: 用 (yòng) itself is a pictograph of a ladle/spoon indicating use.

**Examples**:  
- 这两种货币不能通用。(Zhè liǎng zhǒng huòbì bùnéng tōngyòng.) - These two currencies are not interchangeable.  
- 英语在很多国家都通用。(Yīngyǔ zài hěnduō guójiā dōu tōngyòng.) - English is widely used in many countries.  
- 通用的规则更容易被接受。(Tōngyòng de guīzé gèng róngyì bèi jiēshòu.) - Universal rules are more easily accepted.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 通用 (tōngyòng) is often used for things/shareable resources (rules, languages, currency) that function/operate universally or are widely accepted.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 通 (tōng) = pass through; 用 (yòng) = use ⇒ What can be “used through” everywhere is “universal” (通用 tōngyòng)!
