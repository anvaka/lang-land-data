**Usage Notes**:  
- **举动** (jǔ dòng) is a formal or neutral term. It refers to someone's specific actions, often with focus on observable behaviors.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think: **举** (jǔ, lift) + **动** (dòng, move) = "Lift/move" → an action or behavior.  
- Imagine someone raising (**举** (jǔ)) their hand and starting to move (**动** (dòng))-that’s an obvious action!
