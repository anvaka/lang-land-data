# **并列 (bìngliè) - Side by side; parallel; to juxtapose**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **并 (bìng)**: Combine, together. Top component "一 (yī)" (one), bottom "立 (lì)" (stand) - originally meant things standing together.  
- **列 (liè)**: Row, arrange. Left "刂 (dāo)" (knife), right "歹 (dǎi)" (bad/dead) - originally related to arranging or cutting apart.

**Examples**:  
- 他们并列第一。(Tāmen bìngliè dì-yī.) - They tied for first place.  
- 请把这些书并列摆放。(Qǐng bǎ zhèxiē shū bìngliè bǎifàng.) - Please arrange these books side by side.  
- 文中出现了两个并列的观点。(Wén zhōng chūxiànle liǎng gè bìngliè de guāndiǎn.) - Two parallel viewpoints appear in the text.

**Usage Notes**:  
Often used in academic, scientific, or ordering contexts to describe things placed or considered next to each other (physically or conceptually).

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine "并 (bìng)" as beings standing together, and "列 (liè)" as a list (列队 lièduì = line up)-so 并列 (bìngliè) means items are "lined up together."
