# **偏差 (piān chā) - deviation; error; bias**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **偏** (piān): Left side is ⺘(piě), the "person" radical, right side is 扁 (biǎn), relating to "flat." Suggests a person moving to one side → "partial," "inclined."  
- **差** (chā): Top is 羊 (yáng, "sheep"), center/bottom overseen by 工 (gōng, "craft"), historically meaning "difference," "gap."

**Examples**:  
- 这个结果有偏差。(Zhè ge jiéguǒ yǒu piānchā.) - There is a deviation in this result.  
- 数据出现了偏差。(Shùjù chūxiàn le piānchā.) - The data showed an error.  
- 他的话有些偏差。(Tā de huà yǒuxiē piānchā.) - What he said is a bit biased.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **偏差** (piānchā) is used for both physical deviations (measurements, trajectories) and abstract errors (opinions, results).  
- Common in academic, scientific, and everyday contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
- **偏** (piān): A "person" (⺘(piě)) leaning/slanting to one side.  
- **差** (chā): Mistaking a "sheep" (羊(yáng)) during your "work" (工(gōng)) → you get "error/difference."
