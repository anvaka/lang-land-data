# **沙发 (shā fā) - Sofa**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 沙 (shā): "Sand." Left: "氵" (three-dots-water) radical; right: "少" (shǎo) meaning "few/little."  
- 发 (fā): "Send out," "emit," or "hair." Top: "⺡" (here simplified, derived from "发" original); bottom: "友" (yǒu) as its phonetic component. Here, used for sound only.

**Examples**:  
- 沙发(shā fā)很舒服(hěn shū fu)。- The sofa is very comfortable.  
- 请(qǐng)坐(zuò)在(zài)沙发(shā fā)上(shàng)。- Please sit on the sofa.  
- 他(tā)买(mǎi)了(le)一张(yì zhāng)新(xīn)沙发(shā fā)。- He bought a new sofa.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 沙发(shā fā) is a loanword from English "sofa."  
- Common measure word: 张 (zhāng).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine "沙(shā)" ("sand") because some sofas are soft and comfy like sitting on sand. "发(fā)" ("emit") because sofas let you "send out" your tiredness!  
- Or: 沙发(shā fā) both start with "S" sounds-just like "sofa."
