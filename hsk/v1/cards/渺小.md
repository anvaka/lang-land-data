# **渺小 (miǎo xiǎo) - Tiny; insignificant**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **渺** (miǎo): Means "vast" or "distant" but here it means "tiny, insignificant." Left: **氵** (shuǐ) "water" radical; right: **少** (shǎo) "few"-suggesting something so small it's barely in the water.  
- **小** (xiǎo): Means "small." Three strokes arranged from top to bottom-one long center, two short sides.

**Examples**:  
- 我们在宇宙中显得很渺小。(Wǒmen zài yǔzhòu zhōng xiǎnde hěn miǎo xiǎo.) - We seem very tiny in the universe.  
- 他感到自己的力量很渺小。(Tā gǎndào zìjǐ de lìliàng hěn miǎo xiǎo.) - He feels his own strength is insignificant.  
- 渺小的问题也值得重视。(Miǎo xiǎo de wèntí yě zhídé zhòngshì.) - Even tiny issues are worth attention.

**Usage Notes**:  
**渺小** (miǎo xiǎo) is often used to describe things that are physically small or metaphorically insignificant, frequently in emotional or philosophical contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine a tiny (**小** (xiǎo)) droplet (**氵** (shuǐ)) lost in a vast (**渺** (miǎo)) ocean-too small to notice.
