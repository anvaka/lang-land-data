# **要 (yào) - to want; need; will; important**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **要** (yào): Top: "⺧" (yú) - means "head," related to "to demand" or "important."
  Bottom: "女" (nǚ) - "woman."
  Combined, it originally depicted a woman with a head covering, extending to "to demand," "to want," and thus "important."

**Examples**:  
- 我要水。(wǒ yào shuǐ.) - I want water.  
- 你要去哪里？(nǐ yào qù nǎlǐ?) - Where do you want to go?  
- 明天要下雨。(míngtiān yào xià yǔ.) - It will rain tomorrow.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **要** (yào) + verb = "want to [do]."  
- Can mean "will" for future actions.  
- Also means "need," but more direct than **需要** (xūyào).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a person (女 nǚ) with a big head (⺧ yú) because they **want** or **need** something important!
