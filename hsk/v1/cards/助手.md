# **助手 (zhùshǒu) - Assistant; Helper**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **助** (zhù): "to help; assist." Left side is 力 (lì, force) - indicating strength, right side is 且 (qiě) - once meant "moreover," but here serves as a phonetic part.  
- **手** (shǒu): "hand." Pictograph of a hand; top strokes represent fingers.

**Examples**:  
- 他是我的助手。(Tā shì wǒ de zhùshǒu.) - He is my assistant.  
- 助手帮我整理文件。(Zhùshǒu bāng wǒ zhěnglǐ wénjiàn.) - The assistant helped me organize files.  
- 这个软件有智能助手。(Zhège ruǎnjiàn yǒu zhìnéng zhùshǒu.) - This software has a smart assistant.

**Usage Notes**:  
助手 (zhùshǒu) is a noun for a person or tool that helps. Used for people (as in jobs) or sometimes digital assistants (like AI).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: 助 (zhù, help) + 手 (shǒu, hand) = "helping hand" → "assistant."
