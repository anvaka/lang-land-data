# **反对 (fǎn duì) - To oppose**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 反 (fǎn): "Oppose, opposite, reverse." Radical: 又 (yòu, "again") at the bottom, emphasizing repetition or action.  
- 对 (duì): "Correct, towards, versus." Radical: 寸 (cùn, "inch") on the right,  (又 yòu, "again") on the left, suggests approaching or facing.

**Examples**:  
- 我 (wǒ) 反对 (fǎn duì) 这个 (zhè ge) 建议 (jiàn yì)。 (Wǒ fǎn duì zhè ge jiàn yì.) - I oppose this suggestion.  
- 他们 (tā men) 反对 (fǎn duì) 新 (xīn) 规定 (guī dìng)。 (Tā men fǎn duì xīn guī dìng.) - They oppose the new rule.  
- 她 (tā) 没有 (méi yǒu) 反对 (fǎn duì)。 (Tā méi yǒu fǎn duì.) - She did not oppose.

**Usage Notes**:  
反对 (fǎn duì) is a verb; it takes objects, often opinions, proposals, or actions. Formal or written contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
反 (fǎn) looks like something turned around: "reverse, oppose."  
对 (duì) means "correct," but with 反 (fǎn), you're against it-so "against what is presented."
