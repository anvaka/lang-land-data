# **嗯 (ēn) - "Mm", "uh-huh", expressing agreement**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **嗯** (ēn): The main radical is 口 (kǒu, "mouth") on the left, indicating relation to sound/speech. The right side 恩 (ēn) means "kindness," but here mainly serves as a phonetic.

**Examples**:  
- 嗯，我知道了。(Ēn, wǒ zhīdào le.) - Mm, I got it.  
- 嗯，好主意！(Ēn, hǎo zhǔyì!) - Uh-huh, good idea!  
- 你要喝水吗？嗯。(Nǐ yào hē shuǐ ma? ēn.) - Do you want water? Mm.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **嗯** (ēn) is a casual interjection to show agreement, acknowledgment, or a thoughtful pause.  
- It's often used in spoken language or chat.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think of 口 (kǒu, "mouth") making a sound and using 恩 (ēn) as the sound itself: say "en" to agree!
