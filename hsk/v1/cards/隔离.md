**Character Breakdown**:  
- **隔** (gé): Left = "阝" (fù, right-side ear radical, phonetically related or indicating a place), right = "鬲" (gé, an ancient cooking vessel; provides pronunciation). Together, means to partition or separate.  
- **离** (lí): Top = "亠" (tóu, lid), middle = "小" (xiǎo, small), bottom = "⻏" (fù, city radical). Literally means "to leave" or "depart from".

**Usage Notes**:
