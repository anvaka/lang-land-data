# **响 (xiǎng) - sound; to make a sound; loud**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 响 (xiǎng): On the left is 口 (kǒu - mouth), indicating sound or speech. On the right is 向 (xiàng - towards), suggesting movement or direction. Together, they relate to sound produced and carried outward.

**Examples**:  
- 闹钟响了。 (nào zhōng xiǎng le.) - The alarm clock rang.  
- 响声很大。 (xiǎng shēng hěn dà.) - The sound is very loud.  
- 电话突然响了。 (diàn huà tū rán xiǎng le.) - The phone suddenly rang.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 响 (xiǎng) can be both a verb ("to ring/sound") and an adjective ("loud"). Often used for things that emit a sound (bells, alarms, phones).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a mouth (口 kǒu) sending sound (向 xiàng - towards) outward-when something “响 (xiǎng),” sound moves from inside to outside.
