# **一点儿 (yì diǎn r) - a little; a bit**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 一 (yī): "one." Simple horizontal line, represents the number 1.  
- 点 (diǎn): "dot; a bit." Bottom: 灬 (huǒ) 'fire' radical; above is 占 (zhàn) meaning "occupy" or "spot."  
- 儿 (r): "son" or noun suffix. Looks like legs, often a diminutive ending, especially in northern (Beijing) Mandarin.

**Examples**:  
- 你会说一点儿中文吗？(nǐ huì shuō yì diǎn r zhōng wén ma?) - Can you speak a little Chinese?  
- 请给我一点儿水。(qǐng gěi wǒ yì diǎn r shuǐ.) - Please give me a little water.  
- 我只想要一点儿。(wǒ zhǐ xiǎng yào yì diǎn r.) - I only want a little.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 一点儿 (yì diǎn r) is used with uncountable nouns to mean "a little bit."  
- Common in northern China; in the south, people often say 一点 (yì diǎn) without 儿 (r).

**Memory Aids**:  
- 想像 (xiǎng xiàng) 一 (yī) is "one," 点 (diǎn) is a "dot" (just a spot), 儿 (r) makes it sound friendly and light-so together, it's just "one little dot" of something!
