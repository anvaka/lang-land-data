# **财富 (cáifù) - Wealth; Fortune**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **财 (cái)**: "money; wealth". Left = "贝 (bèi)" (shell/money), right = "才 (cái)" (talent). Shells were ancient currency-symbolizing valuables.  
- **富 (fù)**: "rich". Top = "宀 (mián)" (roof), inside = "一 (yī)" (one), under that = "口 (kǒu)" (mouth), bottom = "田 (tián)" (field). Implies "having food and land under a roof" = abundance.

**Examples**:  
- 她拥有巨大的财富。(Tā yōngyǒu jùdà de cáifù.) - She possesses great wealth.  
- 健康比财富更重要。(Jiànkāng bǐ cáifù gèng zhòngyào.) - Health is more important than wealth.  
- 他的财富来自于投资。(Tā de cáifù láizì yú tóuzī.) - His wealth comes from investments.

**Usage Notes**:  
财富 (cáifù) is mainly used for material or financial wealth but can refer to valuable resources more broadly (e.g., cultural wealth: 文化财富 (wénhuà cáifù)). Usually used as a noun.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine a "talented" (才, cái) person making money (贝, bèi) to gain wealth (财, cái), and "under a roof" (宀, mián), having a "mouth" (口, kǒu) to eat and a "field" (田, tián) to farm = riches (富, fù).
