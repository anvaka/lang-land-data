# **密度 (mìdù) - Density**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **密 (mì)**: "Dense, tight." Top: 宀 (mián, "roof" radical) indicates "cover"; bottom: 必 (bì), here as phonetic, also means "necessary."  
- **度 (dù)**: "Degree, measure." Left: 广 (guǎng, "wide" radical); right: 度 (dù) includes 又 (yòu, "again") and 廿 (niàn, "twenty"). Suggests measuring or degree.

**Examples**:  
- 水的密度 (shuǐ de mìdù) - The density of water  
- 城市人口密度很高 (chéngshì rénkǒu mìdù hěn gāo) - The population density of the city is very high  
- 这块金属的密度是多少？(zhè kuài jīnshǔ de mìdù shì duōshǎo?) - What is the density of this piece of metal?

**Usage Notes**:  
密度 (mìdù) is used for physical, population, or object densities. Often seen in scientific, mathematical, and geographic contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
密 (mì, "roof"+ "necessary"): To keep something dense, you need a roof to cover what’s tightly packed.  
度 (dù, "wide"+ "again/twenty"): Measuring density is taking the "degree" of how tightly packed things are, again and again.
