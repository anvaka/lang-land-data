# **熄灭 (xī miè) - to extinguish; to put out**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **熄** (xī): Left = 火 (huǒ, "fire", radical for fire element); Right = 息 (xī, "rest, cease"). Suggests "to stop fire."  
- **灭** (miè): Top = 冫(bīng, "ice", radical for cold); Bottom = 灬(huǒ, "fire", as dots). Implies "fire becomes cold/out."

**Examples**:

**Usage Notes**:  
**熄灭** (xī miè) usually refers to stopping something burning, like a lamp, candle, or fire-not typically used for emotional or abstract "extinguishing."

**Memory Aids**:  
- **熄** (xī): Fire (火) "rests" (息) when you put it out.  
- **灭** (miè): Imagine ice (冫) on top putting out the fire dots (灬) below.
