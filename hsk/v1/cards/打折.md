# **打折 (dǎzhé) - to give a discount / to be on sale**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **打 (dǎ)**: means "to hit", "to make", or "to play". On the left is the "hand" radical 扌 (tíshǒupáng), indicating an action involving the hand; on the right is 丁 (dīng), acting as a phonetic component.  
- **折 (zhé)**: means "to break" or "to fold". On top is the "hand" radical 扌 (tíshǒupáng), and on the bottom is 斤 (jīn), meaning "axe" or "catty".

**Examples**:

- 全场商品打八折。(Quánchǎng shāngpǐn dǎ bā zhé.) - All goods are 20% off.

**Usage Notes**:

- Common in shopping contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
- **打 (dǎ)** (to hit) + **折 (zhé)** (to break): "Hit the price" to "break it down"-that is, the price goes down!
