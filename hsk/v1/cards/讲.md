# **讲 (jiǎng) - to speak; to explain**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 讲 (jiǎng):
   - Left: 讠(yán) - "speech" radical, indicates relation to speaking/language
   - Right: 井(jǐng) - means "well", used here for sound; forms part of the phonetic component.

**Examples**:  
- 他喜欢讲故事。(Tā xǐhuān jiǎng gùshi.) - He likes to tell stories.  
- 请你讲慢一点。(Qǐng nǐ jiǎng màn yìdiǎn.) - Please speak slower.  
- 老师在讲课。(Lǎoshī zài jiǎng kè.) - The teacher is lecturing.

**Usage Notes**:  
讲 (jiǎng) is used for "to speak", "to explain", or "to tell". It often appears with objects like 课(kè, class), 故事(gùshi, story), or 话(huà, words).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 讠(yán, speech) on the left as a "speech bubble", and 井(jǐng) on the right as a "well". Imagine drawing words from a deep well when you 讲(jiǎng)-to speak or explain.
