# **盐 (yán) - salt**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 盐 (yán): On the top is "⺩" (yù, jade radical), often relating to minerals. Below is the component "皿" (mǐn, dish/container), indicating something held or contained. Historically, salt is a valuable mineral kept and stored carefully.

**Examples**:  
- 请给我盐。 (Qǐng gěi wǒ yán.) - Please pass me the salt.  
- 这道菜没有盐。 (Zhè dào cài méiyǒu yán.) - This dish has no salt.  
- 盐对身体重要。 (Yán duì shēntǐ zhòngyào.) - Salt is important for the body.

**Usage Notes**:  
盐 (yán) is a noun, often used for table salt or in the context of flavoring food. For compounds like 盐水 (yánshuǐ, saltwater) or 海盐 (hǎiyán, sea salt), it attaches to other nouns.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of the "jade" (⺩, yù) radical on top representing something precious; salt was once as valuable as jade! The "dish" (皿, mǐn) at the bottom reminds you salt is kept in a container.
