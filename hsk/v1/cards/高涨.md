# **高涨 (gāo zhàng) - To surge; soar; rise steeply**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **高** (gāo): high, tall. Top: "亠" (tóu, lid/head), bottom: "口" (kǒu, mouth) above "冋" (jiōng, borders). Suggests height.  
- **涨** (zhàng): to rise (of water, emotions, prices). Left: "氵" (shuǐ, water radical), right: "张" (zhāng, to stretch/expand). Suggests something swelling up like water.

**Examples**:

**Usage Notes**:  
高涨 (gāozhàng) is often used for abstract concepts that can "rise" (e.g., prices, emotions, enthusiasm) and less often for physical height.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: 高 (gāo, high) + 涨 (zhàng, swelling) = something swelling up high! Visualize a wave rising far above the surface.
