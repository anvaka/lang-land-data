# **终点 (zhōngdiǎn) - End point, finish line**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 终 (zhōng): "end, finish." Left side: 纟(sī) "silk" radical; right side: 冬(dōng) "winter." Silk at the end of winter → things coming to an end.  
- 点 (diǎn): "point, dot." Top: 卜(bǔ) "divination"; inside: 灬(huǒ) "fire" dots. A small mark or dot, like a spark.

**Examples**:  
- 比赛的终点 (Bǐsài de zhōngdiǎn) - The finish line of the competition  
- 你快到终点了！(Nǐ kuài dào zhōngdiǎn le!) - You’re almost at the finish line!  
- 这是我们的终点吗？(Zhè shì wǒmen de zhōngdiǎn ma?) - Is this our destination/end point?

**Usage Notes**:  
终点 (zhōngdiǎn) most often refers to the final destination in a journey or a race. Not usually used for ending abstract things like conversations or events.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine a thread (丝 sī) running all the way to the winter (冬 dōng)-when it’s finished, you’ve reached your 终点 (zhōngdiǎn), or end point.
