# **玩 (wán) - to play; to have fun**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 玩 (wán): Left: 王 (wáng, "king"; here as the jade radical). Right: 元 (yuán, "beginning" or "first"). The jade radical on the left often relates to things of value or play, and the combination hints at leisure or amusement.

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢玩游戏。(Wǒ xǐhuān wán yóuxì.) - I like to play games.  
- 小孩子们在外面玩。(Xiǎo háizimen zài wàimiàn wán.) - The children are playing outside.  
- 你周末想玩什么？(Nǐ zhōumò xiǎng wán shénme?) - What do you want to do for fun this weekend?

**Usage Notes**:  
- 玩 (wán) is commonly used for "play" (games, toys, instruments), "have fun," or casual activities.  
- Not used for sports-use 打 (dǎ) or 踢 (tī) for playing sports.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a king 王 (wáng) having 元 (yuán, original) fun-kings play with precious things!  
- The left "king jade" + right "origin" = originally having fun!
