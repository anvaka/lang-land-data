# **码头 (mǎtóu) - Dock / Wharf**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 码 (mǎ): Left side is 石 (shí, "stone") radical; right side is 码 (mǎ), phonetic component. Originally refers to a "code/number", here means "dock" when combined.  
- 头 (tóu): Bottom 大 (dà, “big”) is the radical and forms the body. The small hook + dot above are the simplified traces of the traditional “頁” (yè, head), suggesting the head sitting on a big body.

**Examples**:  
- 渔船停在码头。(Yúchuán tíng zài mǎtóu.) - The fishing boat is docked at the wharf.  
- 我们去码头散步吧。(Wǒmen qù mǎtóu sànbù ba.) - Let’s go for a walk at the dock.  
- 码头非常热闹。(Mǎtóu fēicháng rènào.) - The dock is very lively.

**Usage Notes**:  
码头 (mǎtóu) refers to a physical place where boats dock, not to be confused with 车站 (chēzhàn, "station") for buses/trains. Used in transportation/travel contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
码 (mǎ, "code/number") + 头 (tóu, "head/end") = the "start/end point" for boats, like a dock. Imagine counting (码 mǎ) boats at the "head" (头 tóu) of the river!
