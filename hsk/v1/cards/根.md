# **根 (gēn) - root; basis; MW for long, thin objects**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **根** (gēn): Left = 木 (mù, "wood/tree," radical for things related to plants); Right = 艮 (gèn, "stopping," provides sound and sometimes an idea of firmness)

**Examples**:  
- 树根 (shùgēn) - tree root  
- 根本不懂 (gēnběn bù dǒng) - not understand at all  
- 一根香蕉 (yì gēn xiāngjiāo) - one banana (banana as a long object)

**Usage Notes**:  
- **根** (gēn) is used for physical roots (like that of a plant), as well as abstract "basis" or "source."  
- Also a measure word for long, thin items (e.g. 一根蜡烛 yì gēn làzhú - one candle).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a **tree** (木 mù) with its **root** firmly **stopping** (艮 gèn) in the ground.  
- "Gen" sounds like "gun"; picture a gun-shaped root underground (for long, thin measure word).
