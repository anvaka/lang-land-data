**Character Breakdown**:  
- **讲 (jiǎng)** - "to speak, explain." Left: 讠(yán), "speech" radical. Right: 井(jǐng), a well; here for phonetic value.  
- **座 (zuò)** - "seat, place; to sit." Top: 广(guǎng), "building" or "wide." Bottom/inside: 坐(zuò), "to sit," composed of two 人(rén), "person," on 土(tǔ), "earth."

**Usage Notes**:  
讲座(jiǎngzuò) is formal, usually for academic or professional talks by experts. Use 参加(jiānjiā) (to attend), 举办(jǔbàn) (to hold), or 听(tīng) (to listen to) with it.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think "讲(jiǎng): to speak" + "座(zuò): a seat" = "A place where people sit and listen to someone speak: a lecture."
