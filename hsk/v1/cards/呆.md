# **呆 (dāi) - to stay; foolish; stunned**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **呆 (dāi)**: The top is "口 (kǒu)" meaning "mouth". The bottom is "木 (mù)" meaning "wood". Combined, it suggests a "mouth" above "wood", visually appearing stiff and unmoving-reflecting stillness or dullness.

**Examples**:  
- 他呆在家里。(Tā dāi zài jiā lǐ.) - He stays at home.  
- 她看起来很呆。(Tā kàn qǐlái hěn dāi.) - She looks very dazed.  
- 别呆站着，快走！(Bié dāi zhànzhe, kuài zǒu!) - Don’t just stand there, go quickly!

**Usage Notes**:  
- 呆 (dāi) can mean "to stay," as in "呆在...(dāi zài...)", and also "dull," "blank," or "stupefied" when describing a person’s expression or intellect.  
- Do not confuse with 待 (dāi/dài), which also means "to stay" but is used in different contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a mouth (口 kǒu) on top of a piece of wood (木 mù)-the "mouth" isn’t speaking, it’s just "staying" still, looking blank or dumb ("dāi").
