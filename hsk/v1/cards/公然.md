# **公然 (gōng rán) - Openly; publicly; flagrantly**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **公 (gōng)**: Means "public", "fair", or "open". The left (left) side is "八 (bā)", meaning "eight" or "divide", often top, indicating division or sharing. The right (right) side is "厶 (sī)", meaning "private" or "oneself". Together, it suggests something that is divided for all (thus, public).  
- **然 (rán)**: Means "so", "thus", or used after adjectives/adverbs for forming adverbs. At the top (top) is "⺨ (quǎn)", the "dog" radical, and below (bottom) is "月 (yuè)", which usually means "moon" or "meat", plus (bottom) "灬 (huǒ)", the "fire" radical.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 公然 (gōng rán) is used for actions that are overt, not hidden, often with a tone of disapproval (e.g., 公然 (gōng rán) 违反 (wéi fǎn), 公然 (gōng rán) 挑战 (tiǎo zhàn)).  
- Can modify negative actions or statements.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 公 (gōng): Think of things made 公 (gōng) (public), visible to all.  
- 然 (rán): Sounds like "ran"-once something is 公然 (gōng rán), it has "run" out into the open!
