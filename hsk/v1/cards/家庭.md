# **家庭 (jiā tíng) - Family; household**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **家** (jiā): Top is 宀 (mián, "roof"), symbolizing a house; bottom is 豕 (shǐ, "pig")-in ancient times, having pigs under the roof meant prosperity.  
- **庭** (tíng): Left side is 广 (guǎng, "wide shelter/yard" on the top left), right is 廷 (tíng, meaning "court/hall"), denoting an enclosed courtyard.

**Examples**:  
- 我的家庭很幸福。(Wǒ de jiā tíng hěn xìng fú.) - My family is very happy.  
- 她有一个大家庭。(Tā yǒu yí gè dà jiā tíng.) - She has a big family.  
- 家庭成员都来了。(Jiā tíng chéng yuán dōu lái le.) - All family members have arrived.

**Usage Notes**:  
**家庭** (jiā tíng) is more formal and refers to the household/family unit, not just relatives (**家人** (jiā rén)). Used in written or formal contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of **家** (jiā) as "a roof with a pig (happiness) inside" and **庭** (tíng) as "a wide area for your family to gather." Together, they build a happy home!
