**Character Breakdown**:  
- **格 (gé)**: "Pattern"/"Standard". Left: 木 (mù) "wood" (left radical), Right: 各 (gè) "each" (right component). Originates from arranging wood in set patterns.  
- **局 (jú)**: "Bureau"/"Situation"/"Layout". Top: 尸 (shī) "corpse" radical, Below: 口 (kǒu) "mouth" inside 勹 (bāo) "wrap". Originally depicted a space or area bounded by walls.

**Examples**:  
- 房间的格局很合理。(Fángjiān de géjú hěn hélǐ.) - The layout of the room is very reasonable.  
- 公司的格局正在改变。(Gōngsī de géjú zhèngzài gǎibiàn.) - The structure of the company is changing.  
- 他有大格局。(Tā yǒu dà géjú.) - He has a broad vision (big-picture thinking).

**Usage Notes**:  
- **格局 (géjú)** applies to physical layouts (rooms, buildings) and abstract structures (organizations, strategies, mindset).  
- Often used positively to suggest well-organized or visionary arrangements.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine **格 (gé)** as "standards" holding up a structure made of wood, and **局 (jú)** as a "space" defined by boundaries. Combined, **格局 (géjú)** is how something is arranged or structured.
