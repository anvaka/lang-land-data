# **刻不容缓 (kè bù róng huǎn) - No delay allowed; every second counts**

- 不 (bù): "Not," "no." Single stroke turns the "一" (one) into a negative.  
- 容 (róng): "Allow," "tolerate." Roof radical (宀, top), "谷" (valley, inside/below roof).  
- 缓 (huǎn): "Delay," "slow." "纟" (silk, left) + "爰" (lead, right).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think "刻" (kè, moment) + "不容" (bù róng, not allow) + "缓" (huǎn, delay): "Not a moment can be delayed." Imagine a countdown clock-every "刻" (kè) matters!
