- **锻炼(duànliàn)** is a verb, often used with 身体(shēntǐ) "body", or alone.  
- Can refer to physical or mental training, but most commonly means “to exercise (physically)”.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Both characters have the "metal" radical, hinting at the idea of "tempering" or "refining"-just like you "refine" your body when you exercise. Think:锻炼(duànliàn) = temper (锻(duàn)) + refine (炼(liàn)) yourself.
