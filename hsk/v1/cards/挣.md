# **挣 (zhèng/zhēng) - to earn; to struggle**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 挣 (zhèng/zhēng): The left side is 扌 (shǒu), "hand," indicating an action. The right side is 争 (zhēng), meaning "to contend" or "to fight." Together, it suggests striving with one's hands-thus, "to earn" or "to struggle."

**Examples**:  
- 他在工厂里挣 (zhèng) 钱 (qián)。 (tā zài gōngchǎng lǐ zhèng qián.) - He earns money in a factory.  
- 他们为了生存挣 (zhēng) 扎 (zhā) 着。 (tāmen wèile shēngcún zhēngzhā zhe.) - They are struggling for survival.  
- 我想挣 (zhèng) 更多的钱。 (wǒ xiǎng zhèng gèng duō de qián.) - I want to earn more money.

**Usage Notes**:  
挣 (zhèng) usually means “to earn” (money), while 挣 (zhēng) can also mean “to struggle” or “to strive.” Context and tone determine pronunciation.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine using your 手 (shǒu) (hand) to 争 (zhēng) (struggle/fight) for money-so 挣 (zhèng) means both to "earn" (working with hands) and "struggle."
