# **濒临 (bīnlín) - to be on the verge of; to be close to**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 濒 (bīn): left/水(shuǐ, water) radical; right/频(pín, frequent) component. Means "to be near (water or danger)."  
- 临 (lín): top/⺁(àn, cliff); bottom/品(pǐn, item). Means "to face; to approach."

**Examples**:  
- 这只动物濒临灭绝。(Zhè zhī dòngwù bīnlín mièjué.) - This animal is on the verge of extinction.  
- 湖水濒临满溢。(Húshuǐ bīnlín mǎnyì.) - The lake water is about to overflow.

**Usage Notes**:  
濒临 (bīnlín) usually precedes nouns indicating a situation, place, or danger (e.g., 灾难(zāinàn, disaster)、死亡(sǐwáng, death)). It emphasizes proximity to a critical point.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: 濒 (bīn, "near") with the "water" radical means "close to (danger)." 临 (lín, "approach") means you're right in front of something. So 濒临 (bīnlín) = nearly facing something critical.
