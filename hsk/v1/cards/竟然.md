# **竟然 (jìng rán) - Unexpectedly; actually**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 竟 (jìng): Top "立" (lì, stand), bottom "音" (yīn, sound); originally means "finish, go to the end," implying "to an unexpected result."  
- 然 (rán): Left "灬" (huǒ, fire) at bottom, right "月" (yuè, moon/meat) + "犬" (quǎn, dog) above; often part of words meaning "so, thus, as such."

**Examples**:  
- 他( tā )竟然( jìng rán )没( méi )来( lái )。 (Tā jìngrán méi lái.) - He actually didn't come.  
- 她( tā )竟然( jìng rán )会( huì )说( shuō )中文( zhōng wén )！ (Tā jìngrán huì shuō zhōngwén!) - She can speak Chinese, unexpectedly!  
- 雨( yǔ )竟然( jìng rán )下( xià )了一天( yī tiān )。 (Yǔ jìngrán xià le yī tiān.) - It rained unexpectedly for the entire day.

**Usage Notes**:  
竟然 (jìng rán) expresses surprise or goes against expectation, usually before the verb or adjective.

**Memory Aids**:  
Picture “竟 (jìng)” as “results standing” (立, lì) unexpectedly with a “sound (音, yīn),” and “然 (rán)” like a reaction “burning (灬, huǒ)” at the bottom, highlighting unexpectedness.
