# **着 (zhe / zháo / zhuó) - aspect marker; to touch; to wear**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **着** (zhe / zháo / zhuó):
  - Radical: 羊(yáng, "sheep") on top
  - Component: 目(mù, "eye") on bottom
  - Historically means "to touch", "to make contact", later used for ongoing action or state.

**Examples**:  
- 他(tā)正在(zhèngzài)看着(kànzhe)书(shū)。 (Tā zhèngzài kànzhe shū.) - He is (currently) reading a book.

**Usage Notes**:  
- Most common as **着**(zhe), a particle after verbs indicating a continuing state ("-ing" in English).  
- Also pronounced **zháo** (to succeed in, as in "找着(zhǎozháo)" = found), or **zhuó** (to wear, formal/lit.).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a sheep (羊yáng) *eyeing* (目mù) something-it’s continuously watching, just like an ongoing action.  
- "抓着(zhuāzhe)": imagine "grabbed and still holding."
