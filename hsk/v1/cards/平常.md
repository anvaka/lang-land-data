# **平常 (píngcháng) - usually; ordinarily**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **平 (píng)**: "flat," "even," or "level." The top is 一 (yī, "one"), under which is 干 (gān, "dry" or "shield").  
- **常 (cháng)**: "usual," "often." Top is 宀 (mián, "roof"), middle is 尚 (shàng, "still/yet"), bottom is a small horizontal. 宀 (mián) gives the idea of something regular or within a household.

**Examples**:  
- 我 (wǒ) 平常 (píngcháng) 七点 (qī diǎn) 起床 (qǐchuáng)。 (wǒ píngcháng qī diǎn qǐchuáng) - I usually get up at 7 o'clock.  
- 她 (tā) 平常 (píngcháng) 不 (bù) 喝 (hē) 咖啡 (kāfēi)。 (tā píngcháng bù hē kāfēi) - She doesn't usually drink coffee.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 平常 (píngcháng) is an adverb, used before verbs. Similar to "usually" or "ordinarily" in English.  
- Can also be a noun meaning "everyday life" in some contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 平 (píng) = "even," so things are even/normal.  
- 常 (cháng) = "often;" with a roof (宀, mián) on top, think of what is common under your own roof.  
- When things are 平 (píng, flat/even), they're 常 (cháng, usual) - life is "as usual."
