# **歪 (wāi) - Crooked, askew, slanted, tilted**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **歪** (wāi): Left side is **不** (bù; "not") tilting slightly; right side is **止** (zhǐ; "stop")-implying something is “not upright” or "not right." Radical: **止** (zhǐ; "stop") at the right.

**Examples**:  
- 这把椅子歪了。(zhè bǎ yǐzi wāi le.) - This chair is crooked.  
- 他把帽子戴歪了。(tā bǎ màozi dài wāi le.) - He put his hat on askew.  
- 字写歪了。(zì xiě wāi le.) - The characters were written slanted.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **歪** (wāi) often describes physical slant/tilt, can also be used metaphorically (e.g., **思想歪** (sīxiǎng wāi), "crooked thoughts").  
- Opposite: **正** (zhèng; "upright, straight").

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine **不** (bù) is being stopped from being straight by **止** (zhǐ), so it ends up **歪** (wāi)-not straight, or crooked.
