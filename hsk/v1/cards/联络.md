# **联络 (liánluò) - To contact; to connect**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **联** (lián): Left: 耳 (ěr) "ear" radical. Right: 关 (guān) means "close/join." Together suggests connecting through sound or ear.  
- **络** (luò): Left: 纟(sī) "silk" radical (thread) for connection. Right: 各 (gè) "each," meaning to network or weave together.

**Examples**:

- 我会与他联络。(Wǒ huì yǔ tā liánluò.) - I will get in touch with him.  
- 他们保持联络。(Tāmen bǎochí liánluò.) - They keep in contact.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **联络** (liánluò) is formal, used for establishing or maintaining contact.  
- For casual contact, **联系** (liánxì) is more common.  
- Used as both verb and noun.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine "ears" (**联** lián) and "threads" (**络** luò) joining people together-contact is like weaving a network through sound.
