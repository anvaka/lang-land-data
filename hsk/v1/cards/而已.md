# **而已 (éryǐ) - only; nothing more**

- 而 (ér): conjunction meaning "and," "but," or simply marks a transition. Top: a horizontal line; Bottom: complex strokes forming "而."  
- 已 (yǐ): means "already." Top: horizontal stroke; Bottom: stylized mouth shape.

**Examples**:  
- 我(wǒ)只是(zhǐ shì)开玩笑(kāi wán xiào)而已(éryǐ)。 (Wǒ zhǐ shì kāi wán xiào ér yǐ.) - I was just joking, that's all.  
- 他(tā)是(shì)普通人(pǔ tōng rén)而已(éryǐ)。 (Tā shì pǔ tōng rén ér yǐ.) - He is just an ordinary person, nothing more.  
- 这(zhè)只(zhǐ)是一( yī)个(gè)建议(jiàn yì)而已(éryǐ)。 (Zhè zhǐ shì yī gè jiàn yì ér yǐ.) - This is just a suggestion, that's all.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 而已 (éryǐ) is usually used at the end of a sentence to express limitation/restriction, similar to “only,” “just,” or “that’s all.”  
- Often follows phrases with 只是 (zhǐ shì) or 不过 (bù guò).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine "而 (ér)" as a bridge (transition), and "已 (yǐ)" as a stop sign ("already finished"). Put together: the matter stops here-it's only that!
