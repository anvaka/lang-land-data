# **弊端 (bì duān) - Drawback; Disadvantage; Abuse**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **弊** (bì): "harm," "fraud," or "abuse." The "廾" (gǒng, two hands) at the bottom + "敝" (bì) at the top, which means "tattered," indicating something that is broken or corrupt.  
- **端** (duān): "end" or "extremity." "立" (lì, to stand) on the top; "山" (shān, mountain) in the middle; "而" (ér, beard) at the bottom, signifying something at the edge or extremity.

**Examples**:  
- 这种制度有不少弊端。 (Zhè zhǒng zhìdù yǒu bù shǎo bìduān.) - This system has quite a few drawbacks.  
- 改革可以减少弊端。 (Gǎigé kěyǐ jiǎnshǎo bìduān.) - Reforms can reduce abuses.  
- 长期忽视这些弊端会带来严重后果。 (Chángqī hūshì zhèxiē bìduān huì dàilái yánzhòng hòuguǒ.) - Ignoring these abuses for a long time will bring serious consequences.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **弊端** (bìduān) is typically used in formal or written contexts to discuss systematic or structural problems, often in institutions, processes, or policies.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Picture **弊** (bì) as "broken (敝) hands (廾)" causing problems, and **端** (duān) as reaching the "end/extremity" of an issue. Together: the far end where harm emerges = **弊端** (bìduān).
