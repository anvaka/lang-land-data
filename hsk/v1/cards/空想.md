# **空想 (kōngxiǎng) - Daydream / Fantasy**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **空** (kōng): "empty", "sky". Left/right: Left has "穴" (xué, cave/roof), right has "工" (gōng, work); together convey "emptiness".  
- **想** (xiǎng): "to think", "to imagine". Top/bottom: Top is "相" (xiāng, to look), bottom is "心" (xīn, heart); thinking arises from the heart/mind.

**Examples**:  
- 他总是在空想。(Tā zǒng shì zài kōngxiǎng.) - He is always daydreaming.  
- 空想无法实现目标。(Kōngxiǎng wúfǎ shíxiàn mùbiāo.) - Fantasizing can't achieve goals.  
- 我们需要实际行动，不只是空想。(Wǒmen xūyào shíjì xíngdòng, bù zhǐshì kōngxiǎng.) - We need real action, not just wishful thinking.

**Usage Notes**:  
**空想** (kōngxiǎng) is often used negatively to describe unrealistic or impractical thoughts. It is typically a noun or verb ("to fantasize").

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of **空** (kōng, empty) plus **想** (xiǎng, to think) = "empty thinking" = daydreaming/fantasizing.
