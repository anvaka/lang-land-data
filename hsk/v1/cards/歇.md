# **歇 (xiē) - to rest; to take a break**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 歇 (xiē):
  - Radical: 欠 (qiàn, "yawn; lack") on the right
  - Component: 歹 (dǎi, "death/bad") on the left
  - Suggests "resting" (to pause/exhaustion) by combining "tired/death" and "yawn/lack"

**Examples**:  
- 我们歇一下吧。(Wǒmen xiē yíxià ba.) - Let’s take a break.  
- 他累得不得了，需要歇歇。(Tā lèi de bùdéliǎo, xūyào xiēxiē.) - He’s extremely tired and needs to rest.  
- 歇会儿再继续吧。(Xiē huìr zài jìxù ba.) - Let’s rest a while and then continue.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 歇 (xiē) is mostly used in informal speech and can be paired with 一下 (yíxià), 会儿 (huìr), or used repetitively as 歇歇 (xiēxiē).  
- Common in northern dialects.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Picture someone so tired ("death" 歹 (dǎi) left) that they must pause and "yawn" (欠 (qiàn) right)-that's a clear sign they need to 歇 (xiē)!
