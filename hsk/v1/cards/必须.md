# **必须 (bìxū) - must; have to**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 必 (bì) - means "must" or "certainly." The top (丿) suggests a decisive act; the bottom (心, xīn) means "heart," signifying something felt or required from the heart.  
- 须 (xū) - means "need" or "must." Left (彡, shān) represents hair; right (页, yè) means "page/head." Combined, it extends the idea to "requirement" or "necessity."

**Examples**:  
- 我们必须 (wǒmen bìxū) 准时到。 (zhǔnshí dào.) - We must arrive on time.  
- 你必须 (nǐ bìxū) 完成作业。 (wánchéng zuòyè.) - You have to finish the homework.  
- 必须 (bìxū) 休息一下。 (xiūxi yíxià.) - (You) must take a rest.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 必须 (bìxū) is stronger than 应该 (yīnggāi, "should") and expresses necessity or obligation.  
- Often followed by a verb or verb phrase.

**Memory Aids**:  
- "必 (bì)" has a "heart (心, xīn)"-it's what your heart "must" do.  
- Think: "Must (必, bì) and need (须, xū) always go together-必须 (bìxū)!"
