# **挨 (āi / ái) - to be close to; to suffer/endure**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 挨 (āi / ái): Left = 扌(shǒu, hand radical), indicating action; Right = 皑(ái), phonetic, means "white" or "glittering" (here provides sound).

**Examples**:  
- 他( tā )挨( āi )着( zhe )我( wǒ )坐( zuò )。(Tā āi zhe wǒ zuò.) - He is sitting next to me.  
- 她( tā )经常( jīngcháng )挨( ái )骂( mà )。(Tā jīngcháng ái mà.) - She often gets scolded.  
- 小狗( xiǎo gǒu )挨( āi )在( zài )门( mén )边( biān )。(Xiǎo gǒu āi zài mén biān.) - The puppy is by the door.

**Usage Notes**:  
挨(āi) often means "to be close to," while 挨(ái), same character but second tone, means "to suffer" or "to endure." Meaning depends on context and tone.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine your "hand" (扌 shǒu) "near" (挨 āi) someone, or your "hand" (扌 shǒu) "suffering" (挨 ái) a hardship-so the hand component helps recall both closeness and enduring.
