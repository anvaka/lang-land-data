# **茎 (jīng) - Stem**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **茎 (jīng)**:
  - Top: 艹 (cǎo) - "grass" radical, indicates relation to plants.
  - Bottom: 圣 (shèng) - means "holy," here acts as the phonetic component.

**Examples**:  
- 植物的茎(jīng)很长。(Zhíwù de jīng hěn cháng.) - The plant's stem is very long.  
- 这是一根竹茎(zhú jīng)。(Zhè shì yī gēn zhú jīng.) - This is a bamboo stem.  
- 茎(jīng)可以运输水分。(Jīng kěyǐ yùnshū shuǐfèn.) - The stem can transport water.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 茎(jīng) is mainly used in botanical contexts to refer to plant stems (not for meat or other "stems").  
- Used as both singular and plural.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 艹(cǎo) on top = plant; 圣(shèng) sounds like "jīng," connecting to the pronunciation.  
- Imagine the stem (茎 jīng) as the "holy" path (圣 shèng) for water inside a plant (艹 cǎo on top).
