# **片面 (piàn miàn) - One-sided; biased**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 片 (piàn): Piece, slice. Left side: ⺈ (piān zì páng), resembles a knife; right side: 片 (piàn) itself represents a split or slice.  
- 面 (miàn): Face, surface, side. Top: 宀 (mián) indicates roof; below: men (mén) inside the enclosure, collectively resembles a face or surface.

**Examples**:  
- 他的看法很片面。(Tā de kànfǎ hěn piànmiàn.) - His viewpoint is very one-sided.  
- 我们不能片面地判断问题。(Wǒmen bùnéng piànmiàn de pànduàn wèntí.) - We can't judge issues one-sidedly.  
- 她给出的理由太片面了。(Tā gěi chū de lǐyóu tài piànmiàn le.) - The reason she gave is too one-sided.

**Usage Notes**:  
Usually used to criticize arguments or opinions lacking consideration for all sides. Often modified by 很(hěn), 太(tài), or adverbs.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of "片(piàn)" as a "slice" and "面(miàn)" as a "side": only looking at a "slice of the side" means not seeing the whole picture!
