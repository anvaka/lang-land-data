# **痕迹 (hén jì) - Trace, Mark, Vestige**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **痕** (hén): "mark; scar." Left: ⽧(疒, "sickness" radical, left side); Right: 艮 (gèn, "stopping" or "firm"). Suggests a mark left due to injury or event.  
- **迹** (jì): "trace; footprint." Left: ⻌(辶, "walk/movement" radical, left side); Right: 亦 (yì, "also"). Indicates something left behind during movement.

**Examples**:  
- 地上有汽车的痕迹。(Dì shàng yǒu qìchē de hénjì.) - There are tire marks on the ground.  
- 他没有留下任何痕迹。(Tā méiyǒu liú xià rènhé hénjì.) - He left no trace at all.  
- 时间会抹去伤痛的痕迹。(Shíjiān huì mǒqù shāngtòng de hénjì.) - Time will erase the traces of pain.

**Usage Notes**:  
**痕迹** (hénjì) often refers to physical marks, traces, or metaphoric signs left behind by actions or things (e.g., time’s traces, evidence, imprints).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of **痕** (hén) as a "scar (疒, left) that stopped (艮, right)" and **迹** (jì) as "traces (辶, left) left also (亦, right) behind." So, **痕迹** (hénjì) = marks left after something happened.
