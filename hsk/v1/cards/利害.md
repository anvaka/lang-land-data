# **利害 (lìhài) - Advantage and Disadvantage / Serious / Impressive**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **利** (lì): left = "⻌" (dāo; knife radical), right = "禾" (hé; grain). Originally meant "sharp" or "benefit".  
- **害** (hài): top = "宀" (mián; roof), middle = "口" (kǒu; mouth), bottom = "丰" (fēng; abundant). Means "harm", also appears in "damage" or "danger".

**Examples**:  
- 你知道这件事的利害吗？(Nǐ zhīdào zhè jiàn shì de lìhài ma?) - Do you know the pros and cons of this matter?  
- 他很利害。(Tā hěn lìhài.) - He is very impressive/awesome.  
- 这件事很利害。(Zhè jiàn shì hěn lìhài.) - This matter is very serious.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **利害** (lìhài) can mean "pros and cons" in formal contexts or "serious"/"awesome" in spoken Chinese describing skills or situations.  
- As an adjective, **利害** (lìhài) often means "fierce", "formidable", or "impressive".

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think: "利" (lì; benefit) versus "害" (hài; harm), so **利害** (lìhài) covers both sides of an issue, or when someone is so “sharp” they’re “dangerous”.
