# **堆积 (duī jī) - To pile up; to accumulate**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **堆** (duī): "Heap; pile." Left: 土 (tǔ, "earth") radical indicates earth/material. Right: 隹 (zhuī, "short-tailed bird") acts phonetically.  
- **积** (jī): "Accumulate." Left: 禾 (hé, "grain") radical (top/left), relating to harvest piles. Right: 只 (zhǐ, "only") phonetic.

**Examples**:  
- 雪在屋顶上堆积。(Xuě zài wū dǐng shàng duī jī.) - Snow piles up on the roof.  
- 文件在桌子上堆积如山。(Wén jiàn zài zhuō zi shàng duī jī rú shān.) - Documents are piled up like a mountain on the desk.  
- 问题开始堆积。(Wèn tí kāi shǐ duī jī.) - The problems begin to accumulate.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 堆积 (duī jī) is used for both physical (snow, things) and abstract (problems, emotions) accumulation.  
- Often appears as 堆积如山 (duī jī rú shān, "piled up like a mountain") for exaggeration.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine 土 (tǔ, "earth") forming piles (堆 duī) and 禾 (hé, "grain") gathering (积 jī); together: "stuff stacking up."
