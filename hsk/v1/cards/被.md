# **被 (bèi) - Passive marker; "by" / to be (in a passive sentence)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 被 (bèi): Left-"衤(yī)" radical (related to clothing), right-"皮(pí)" (skin, leather). Originally referred to a quilt or something that covers the body. Now, commonly used as a passive voice marker.

**Examples**:  
- 他( tā )被( bèi )老师( lǎoshī )表扬( biǎoyáng )了( le )。 (Tā bèi lǎoshī biǎoyáng le.) - He was praised by the teacher.  
- 我的( wǒ de )手机( shǒujī )被( bèi )偷( tōu )了( le )。 (Wǒ de shǒujī bèi tōu le.) - My phone was stolen.  
- 门( mén )被( bèi )关( guān )上( shàng )了( le )。 (Mén bèi guān shàng le.) - The door was closed (by someone).

**Usage Notes**:  
被(bèi) introduces the agent in passive sentences: [Subject] + 被(bèi) + [Agent] + [Verb]. Often omitting the agent if it's unimportant or unknown.

**Memory Aids**:  
被(bèi) "covers" a subject with an action, similar to how a quilt (original meaning) covers you-think: "covered BY (被 bèi) an action."
