# **成心 (chéng xīn) - Intentionally; on purpose**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 成 (chéng): "to become," "to succeed." Left is 戈 (gē, spear), right is 丁 (dīng, nail) on top of simplified 口 (kǒu, mouth).  
- 心 (xīn): "heart," "mind." The character looks like a stylized heart, with pointed shapes; represents feelings/intentions.

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 是 (shì) 成心 (chéng xīn) 捣乱 (dǎo luàn) 的 (de)。 (He did it on purpose to cause trouble.)  
- 你 (nǐ) 成心 (chéng xīn) 刺激 (cì jī) 我 (wǒ) 吗 (ma)？ (Are you trying to provoke me intentionally?)  
- 她 (tā) 成心 (chéng xīn) 不 (bù) 告诉 (gào sù) 我 (wǒ)。 (She deliberately didn’t tell me.)

**Usage Notes**:  
成心 (chéng xīn) is used to express intention, usually negative (e.g., causing trouble, offending). Often followed by a verb.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "with heart (心 xīn), become (成 chéng) trouble" = to do something with intention!
