# **根源 (gēn yuán) - Root; source; origin**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **根** (gēn): "Root." At the left, the radical **木** (mù, "wood") shows it's related to trees/plants. On the right is **艮** (gèn, a component, often meaning "stopping" or "stubborn").  
- **源** (yuán): "Source." Left has the water radical **氵** (shuǐ, "water") indicating relation to water. On the right is **原** (yuán, "origin") meaning "original place," with **厂** (hǎn, "cliff," top), **白** (bái, "white," inside), and **小** (xiǎo, "small," bottom).
