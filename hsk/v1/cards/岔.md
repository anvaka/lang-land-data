# **岔 (chà) - fork; to diverge; branch**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **岔 (chà)**: Left side is **山 (shān)** "mountain", representing terrain/topography. Right side is **差 (chā)** without the "工 (gōng)" at the bottom, suggesting separation. Together, the character suggests something splitting in the mountains-a fork or branch.

**Examples**:  
- 这里有一个岔路口。(Zhè lǐ yǒu yí gè chà lù kǒu.) - There's an intersection (fork) here.  
- 说话岔开了。(Shuō huà chà kāi le.) - The conversation went off topic.  
- 他在岔道走错了路。(Tā zài chà dào zǒu cuò le lù.) - He took the wrong road at the fork.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **岔 (chà)** is often found in phrases like **岔路 (chà lù)** "forked road" or **岔开 (chà kāi)** "to diverge/separate", referring both to physical splitting (roads, rivers) and figurative divergence (topics).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine climbing a **山 (shān)** (mountain), reaching a point where the road **岔 (chà)** (forks/splits like a "V"). The mountain (left) meets a branch (right)!
