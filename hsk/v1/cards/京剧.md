# **京剧 (jīngjù) - Beijing Opera**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **京 (jīng)**: Means "capital." Top is 亠 (tóu, lid radical) with 小 (xiǎo, small) under it; the structure suggests the roof or head of the capital city.  
- **剧 (jù)**: Means "drama/play." Left is 刂 (dāo, knife radical) indicating action, right is 居 (jū, to reside), conveying performance at a place.

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢京剧。(Wǒ xǐhuan jīngjù.) - I like Beijing Opera.  
- 京剧有悠久的历史。(Jīngjù yǒu yōujiǔ de lìshǐ.) - Beijing Opera has a long history.  
- 他正在学习京剧表演。(Tā zhèngzài xuéxí jīngjù biǎoyǎn.) - He is learning Beijing Opera performance.

**Usage Notes**:  
京剧 (jīngjù) refers specifically to the traditional opera form from Beijing (Běijīng). When describing someone who practices it, use 京剧演员 (jīngjù yǎnyuán, Beijing Opera actor).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 京 (jīng) as the "capital" (Beijing), and 剧 (jù) as a "play" with action (cutting, performing)-so 京剧 (jīngjù) is the "Capital's Play."
