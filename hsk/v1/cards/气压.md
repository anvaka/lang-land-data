# **气压 (qìyā) - Air pressure**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 气 (qì): "air; gas." The top is a wavy line symbolizing vapor; the rest represents steam rising.  
- 压 (yā): "to press; pressure." Top: "厂 (chǎng)" meaning "cliff," below: "压 (yā)" phonetic element, bottom horizontal line suggests being squashed.

**Examples**:  
- 今天的气压 (qìyā) 比较低。(Jīntiān de qìyā bǐjiào dī.) - Today's air pressure is relatively low.  
- 气压 (qìyā) 变化会影响天气。(Qìyā biànhuà huì yǐngxiǎng tiānqì.) - Changes in air pressure can affect the weather.  
- 飞机在高气压 (gāo qìyā) 区域飞行。(Fēijī zài gāo qìyā qūyù fēixíng.) - The plane flies in high air pressure areas.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 气压 (qìyā) is mostly used in science, geography, and weather reports.  
- Can be combined: 高气压 (gāo qìyā, high pressure), 低气压 (dī qìyā, low pressure).

**Memory Aids**:  
- 气 (qì) = air/gas. 压 (yā) = press. Imagine "air being pressed down" to feel the meaning of 气压 (qìyā).
