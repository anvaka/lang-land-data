# **规律 (guīlǜ) - Rule; Law; Regular Pattern**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **规 (guī)**: Left side is 见 (jiàn, to see), right side is 夫 (fū, man) - together suggest observing or following something.  
- **律 (lǜ)**: Left side is 彳 (chì, step/road radical), right side is 聿 (yù, brush/pen, indicating regulation) - together point to the idea of walking according to rules.

**Examples**:  
- 我们要遵守规律。(wǒmen yào zūnshǒu guīlǜ) - We must follow the rules.  
- 生活有一定的规律。(shēnghuó yǒu yídìng de guīlǜ) - Life has a certain pattern.  
- 孩子的作息很有规律。(háizi de zuòxī hěn yǒu guīlǜ) - The child’s daily routine is very regular.

**Usage Notes**:  
规律 (guīlǜ) can refer to natural laws, social rules, habits, or routines. Often used with verbs like 遵守 (zūnshǒu, to obey), 有 (yǒu, to have), or 发现 (fāxiàn, to discover).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 规 (guī, rule) as "seeing" (见, jiàn) and following the "standard" (夫, fū). 律 (lǜ, law) has 彳 (chì, step) to show walking on the correct path, and 聿 (yù, brush) as something regulated or prescribed.
