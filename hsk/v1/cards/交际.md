# **交际 (jiāo jì) - Social interaction; communication**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 交 (jiāo): To intersect, to exchange. Left/right: Left is "父 (fù)" (father/hand action) showing hand movement; right is "亠 (tóu)" (lid/top radical) and "小 (xiǎo)" (small) suggesting gathering together.  
- 际 (jì): Border, boundary, occasion. Left/right: Left is "阝(阔耳旁 fù)" (mound/ear, often relates to place), right is "祭 (jì)" (worship/offering, includes "示 (shì)" spirit radical at bottom and "又 (yòu)" hand at right).

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 很 (hěn) 擅长 (shàn cháng) 交际 (jiāo jì)。 (Tā hěn shàncháng jiāojì.) - He is very good at socializing.  
- 语言 (yǔ yán) 是 (shì) 交际 (jiāo jì) 的 (de) 工具 (gōng jù)。 (Yǔyán shì jiāojì de gōngjù.) - Language is a tool for communication.  
- 在 (zài) 新 (xīn) 环境 (huán jìng)，交际 (jiāo jì) 能力 (néng lì) 很 (hěn) 重要 (zhòng yào)。 (Zài xīn huánjìng, jiāojì nénglì hěn zhòngyào.) - In a new environment, social skills are very important.

**Usage Notes**:  
交际 (jiāo jì) is formal and often used in written or academic contexts. For casual everyday use, 交流 (jiāo liú, interact/c交流) may be more common.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 交 (jiāo, to intersect) as two people coming together, and 际 (jì, boundary) as the edge where they meet-交际 (jiāo jì) is "meeting at the boundary," or interacting with each other.
