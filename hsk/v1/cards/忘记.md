# **忘记 (wàngjì) - to forget**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **忘** (wàng): Top is "亡" (wáng, to perish/lost), bottom is "心" (xīn, heart). Meaning: the heart "loses" or "misses," suggesting forgetting.  
- **记** (jì): Left is "讠" (yán, speech radical), right is "己" (jǐ, self). Meaning: recording something about oneself, thus "to remember" or "to record."

**Examples**:  
- 我( wǒ )忘记( wàngjì )带( dài )钥匙( yàoshi )了( le )。( wǒ wàngjì dài yàoshi le ) - I forgot to bring the keys.

- 他( tā )总是( zǒngshì )忘记( wàngjì )我的( wǒde )名字( míngzi )。( tā zǒngshì wàngjì wǒde míngzi ) - He always forgets my name.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 忘记( wàngjì ) can take nouns, actions, or clauses as objects. Often interchangeable with 忘( wàng ) alone.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine your "heart" (心 xīn) under stress ("亡" wáng), making you forget.  
- 记( jì ) is "speech" (讠yán) + "self" (己jǐ): You forget (忘 wàng) to say something important about yourself (记 jì).
