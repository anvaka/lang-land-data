# **生气 (shēngqì) - Angry / To get angry**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 生 (shēng): "to give birth; to grow; life". Top: 丿 (piě), bottom: 土 (tǔ, "earth")-suggests something sprouting from the ground.  
- 气 (qì): "air; gas; anger". Top: 气 (qì) radical, wavy strokes represent rising air or vapor.

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 生气 (shēngqì) 了 (le)。 (tā shēngqì le.) - He got angry.  
- 不要 (bùyào) 生气 (shēngqì)。 (bùyào shēngqì.) - Don't be angry.

**Usage Notes**:  
生气 (shēngqì) is an intransitive verb ("to get angry") or adjective ("angry"). For "at someone", use 对 (duì) + 人 (rén) + 生气 (shēngqì): 对他 (duì tā) 生气 (shēngqì) - angry at him.

**Memory Aids**:  
生 (shēng) is "life"-when something alive (生 shēng) "releases air" (气 qì), anger is often expressed-think of someone "breathing out" (气 qì) in frustration!
