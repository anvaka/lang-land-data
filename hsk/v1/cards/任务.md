# **任务 (rènwu) - Task; Mission; Assignment**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 任 (rèn): "to assign; duty." Left/Right: Left is 亻(rén, person radical), right is 壬(rén, ninth heavenly stem).  
- 务 (wù): "affair; business." Top is 力(lì, strength), bottom is 夂(zhǐ, go/advance).

**Examples**:  
- 他有一个重要的任务。(Tā yǒu yī gè zhòngyào de rènwu.) - He has an important task.  
- 完成任务以后，她很开心。(Wánchéng rènwu yǐhòu, tā hěn kāixīn.) - After completing the assignment, she was happy.  
- 这是我们的共同任务。(Zhè shì wǒmen de gòngtóng rènwu.) - This is our shared mission.

**Usage Notes**:  
任务 (rènwu) is often used for both concrete tasks (schoolwork, work assignments) and broader missions (goals, responsibilities).  
Can take 做 (zuò, do) or 完成 (wánchéng, complete) as verbs.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 任 (rèn, assign) as a person being given a job, and 务 (wù, affair) as using strength to get things done. Tasks = assignment + effort!
