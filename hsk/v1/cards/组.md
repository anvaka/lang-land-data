# **组 (zǔ) - group; to organize; set**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **组** (zǔ): Left-**纟** (sī, silk radical), commonly linked to thread or connection. Right-**且** (qiě), used phonetically here.

**Examples**:  
- 我们分成两个小组。(Wǒmen fēnchéng liǎng gè xiǎozǔ.) - We are divided into two groups.  
- 请组织一次会议。(Qǐng zǔzhī yí cì huìyì.) - Please organize a meeting.  
- 这个组负责设计。(Zhè ge zǔ fùzé shèjì.) - This group is responsible for design.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **组** (zǔ) is often used as a noun (“group, set”) or a verb (“to organize, assemble”).  
- Common in compounds: **小组** (xiǎozǔ, small group), **组织** (zǔzhī, organize/organization).

**Memory Aids**:  
- The **纟** (sī) radical shows it’s about “connecting threads” - just like forming a group connects people.  
- Imagine “且” (qiě) as multiple lines/people grouped together.
