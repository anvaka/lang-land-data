   - Left: 忄(xīn) "heart" radical, suggests feelings/thoughts
   - Right (top-bottom): 董(dǒng) "to supervise/direct," here indicating pronunciation

**Examples**:  
- 我(wǒ)懂(dǒng)了(le)。 (wǒ dǒng le.) - I understand.  
- 你(nǐ)听(tīng)懂(dǒng)了(le)吗(ma)？ (nǐ tīng dǒng le ma?) - Did you understand (what you heard)?

- 懂(dǒng) often follows verbs like 听(tīng), 看(kàn) to mean "understand by hearing/seeing"  
- Usually negated with 不(bù) or 没(méi)  
- No object needed: just 懂(dǒng) or 懂了(dǒng le) is fine

**Memory Aids**:  
- If your 心(xīn) (heart) "directs" (董(dǒng)) your mind, you truly understand!  
- Imagine your heart (left side) is waving at a director (right side) to signal you "get it"
