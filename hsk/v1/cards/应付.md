# **应付 (yìng fù) - To cope with / deal with**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **应 (yìng)**: Left - "广" (guǎng, shelter); Right - "⺼" (yùe, meat/flesh). Originally means "respond" or "answer".  
- **付 (fù)**: Left - "亻" (rén, person radical); Right - "寸" (cùn, inch). Means "to hand over" or "to pay".

**Examples**:  
- 他很难应付 (tā hěn nán yìng fù) - He has difficulty coping.  
- 我要应付很多工作 (wǒ yào yìng fù hěn duō gōng zuò) - I have to deal with a lot of work.  
- 她能应付各种问题 (tā néng yìng fù gè zhǒng wèn tí) - She can handle all kinds of problems.

**Usage Notes**:  
**应付 (yìng fù)** is used for situations you must manage, not always well, often just to get by. Can be neutral or slightly negative (coping, not excelling).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "应 (yìng, respond) + 付 (fù, hand over)" = you respond and hand over just enough effort to get by.
