# **优异 (yōu yì) - excellent; outstanding**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **优 (yōu)**: Left is 亻 (rén) "person" radical, right is 尤 (yóu) "especially." Overall: describes being outstanding or superior among people.  
- **异 (yì)**: Top is 田 (tián) "field," bottom is 共 (gòng) "together," combining suggests something "different" or "unusual."

**Examples**:  
- 他(Tā) 的(de) 成绩(chéng jì) 非常(fēi cháng) 优异(yōu yì)。 (Tā de chéng jì fēi cháng yōu yì.) - His grades are outstanding.  
- 她(Tā) 在(zài) 比赛(bǐ sài) 中(zhōng) 表现(biǎo xiàn) 优异(yōu yì)。 (Tā zài bǐ sài zhōng biǎo xiàn yōu yì.) - She performed excellently in the competition.  
- 优异(yōu yì) 的(de) 表现(biǎo xiàn) 得到(dé dào) 了(le) 奖励(jiǎng lì)。 (Yōu yì de biǎo xiàn dé dào le jiǎng lì.) - Outstanding performance was rewarded.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 优异(yōu yì) is formal, typically used for achievements, results, or performance.  
- Often modifies abstract nouns: 成绩(chéng jì) (grades), 表现(biǎo xiàn) (performance), etc.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think: 优(yōu) ("superior person") + 异(yì) ("different") = "stands out in a superior way."  
- 优(yōu) looks like a special person; 异(yì) has a "field" showing someone is "different on the field."
