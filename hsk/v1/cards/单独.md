# **单独 (dān dú) - Alone; by oneself; single**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **单 (dān)**: Means "single" or "one." The radical 又 (yòu, "right hand") sits on the bottom, under the top component, which resembles a roof or shelter (on top).  
- **独 (dú)**: Means "alone" or "only." Left side: 犭(quǎn, "dog" radical), right side: 蜀 (shǔ, name of an ancient state), suggesting "being apart" (the dog separated).

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 喜欢 (xǐ huān) 单独 (dān dú) 工作 (gōng zuò)。 (Tā xǐ huān dān dú gōng zuò.) - He likes to work alone.  
- 请 (qǐng) 让我 (ràng wǒ) 单独 (dān dú) 想一想 (xiǎng yī xiǎng)。 (Qǐng ràng wǒ dān dú xiǎng yī xiǎng.) - Please let me think by myself.  
- 她 (tā) 单独 (dān dú) 去了 (qù le) 北京 (Běi jīng)。 (Tā dān dú qù le Běi jīng.) - She went to Beijing alone.

**Usage Notes**:  
单独 (dān dú) is often used before verbs to indicate someone does something alone. Can modify pronouns or nouns.

**Memory Aids**:  
单 (dān) is "single," like a single "room" (the top). 独 (dú) has the "dog" (犭quǎn), who is often "alone."
