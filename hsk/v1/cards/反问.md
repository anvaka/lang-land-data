# **反问 (fǎn wèn) - Rhetorical question / to ask in reply**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **反** (fǎn): to turn over, to oppose. Left side is the radical 又 (yòu - again/hand), right side is 厂 (hǎn - cliff/top), combined indicating reversal.  
- **问** (wèn): to ask. Left side is 门 (mén - door/gate, enclosure on left), right side is 口 (kǒu - mouth, inside), suggesting speaking through a door (to ask).

**Examples**:  
- 他( tā )反问( fǎn wèn )道( dào )：“这( zhè )很( hěn )难( nán )吗( ma )？”( “Is this really difficult?” he asked back rhetorically.)  
- 老师( lǎo shī )用( yòng )反问( fǎn wèn )启发( qǐ fā )我们( wǒ men )思考( sī kǎo )。(The teacher used rhetorical questions to inspire our thinking.)  
- 她( tā )没有( méi yǒu )回答( huí dá )，而是( ér shì )反问( fǎn wèn )了( le )一句( yī jù )。(She didn’t answer, but asked a rhetorical question.)

**Usage Notes**:  
- **反问** (fǎn wèn) is used to question someone back, often not expecting a direct answer.  
- Common in debates to highlight a point or the obviousness of something.

**Memory Aids**:  
- **反** (fǎn) means "reverse," so think: you turn the question back ("反") and ask ("问") in return.
