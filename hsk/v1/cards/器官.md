# **器官 (qìguān) - Organ (of the body)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **器 (qì)**: means "vessel/tool/device." Radical: 口(kǒu, "mouth") appears four times (left/right, top/bottom), indicating containers, with 大(dà, "big") inside (center), suggesting a large device or vessel.  
- **官 (guān)**: means "official/organ." Top: 宀(mián, "roof"), Bottom: 㠯(yǐ), symbolizing a person under a roof historically associated with officials in an office - here, refers to a functional part (organ) in a body.

**Examples**:  
- 心脏(qíng zàng)是重要的器官(qìguān)。 (Xīnzàng shì zhòngyào de qìguān.) - The heart is an important organ.  
- 人体有很多器官(qìguān)。 (Réntǐ yǒu hěn duō qìguān.) - The human body has many organs.  
- 肺(fèi)是呼吸系统的主要器官(qìguān)。 (Fèi shì hūxī xìtǒng de zhǔyào qìguān.) - The lung is the main organ of the respiratory system.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 器官(qìguān) refers to physical organs in living beings, not musical instruments or organizations (those would use different words). Common in biology, medicine, and anatomy contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 器(qì) = tools (many parts) → organs have many parts/functions.  
- 官(guān) = official → each organ has an "official" job in the body.
