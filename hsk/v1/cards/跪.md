# **跪 (guì) - to kneel**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 跪 (guì): Left: 足 (zú, "foot" radical, bottom-left, indicates relation to feet/legs). Right: 圭 (guī, "jade tablet," top-right/bottom-right, phonetic component).

**Examples**:  
- 他跪在地上。(Tā guì zài dì shang.) - He is kneeling on the ground.  
- 请你不要跪下来。(Qǐng nǐ bú yào guì xiàlái.) - Please don’t kneel down.  
- 她向老师跪拜。(Tā xiàng lǎoshī guì bài.) - She knelt to salute the teacher.

**Usage Notes**:  
跪 (guì) is often used in formal, traditional, or religious settings (worship, apology, respect). Commonly followed by 在 (zài, "at/on") plus a location.

**Memory Aids**:  
The "足" (zú, foot) radical shows you use your feet, and "圭" (guī) looks like someone kneeling on the ground. Think: “Put your feet on the earth, like kneeling.”
