# **居然 (jū rán) - Actually; Unexpectedly**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 居 (jū): "to reside", "to live". Left: 尸 (shī, "corpse" radical, top), Right: 古 (gǔ, "old" component, bottom).  
- 然 (rán): "however", "so"; often used as a grammatical particle. Top: ⺧ (niú, "cow" radical), Middle: 月 (yuè, "moon"), Bottom: 灬 (huǒ, "fire" dots).

**Examples**:  
- 他居然来了。(Tā jū rán lái le.) - He actually came.  
- 你居然不知道？(Nǐ jū rán bù zhī dào?) - You actually don't know?  
- 这花居然还没死。(Zhè huā jū rán hái méi sǐ.) - This flower is unexpectedly still alive.

**Usage Notes**:  
居然 (jū rán) expresses surprise, often at something unanticipated or against expectations. Used before the action word/verb.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine someone "residing"(居, jū) somewhere, and something "however"(然, rán) happens-unexpectedly! Connecting 居然 (jū rán) with "out of place, surprisingly" happenings will help recall its meaning.
