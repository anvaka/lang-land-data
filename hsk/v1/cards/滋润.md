# **滋润 (zī rùn) - Moist; to moisten; nourishing**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **滋 (zī)**: Left is "氵" (shuǐ, water radical) on the left, indicating relation to liquid, and "兹" (zī, here means "this/now") on the right. Refers to "increase," "nourish," or "moisten."  
- **润 (rùn)**: Left is "氵" (shuǐ, water radical), right is "闰" (rùn, originally meant "leap [as in leap month]"). Means "moist," "smooth," or "profit."

**Examples**:  
- 这场雨让土地变得滋润。(Zhè chǎng yǔ ràng tǔdì biàn de zī rùn.) - This rain made the land moist.  
- 多喝水可以滋润皮肤。(Duō hē shuǐ kěyǐ zī rùn pífū.) - Drinking more water can moisten the skin.  
- 她的生活过得很滋润。(Tā de shēnghuó guò de hěn zī rùn.) - Her life is very comfortable/nourishing.

**Usage Notes**:  
滋润 (zī rùn) describes physical moisture or figurative richness/comfort (e.g., comfortable life). Can be used as adjective or verb.

**Memory Aids**:  
Both characters have 水 (shuǐ, water) radical on the left-think "water brings nourishment and moisture." 滋 (zī) sounds like "zest," 润 (rùn) like "run"-"water runs to add zest/moisture."
