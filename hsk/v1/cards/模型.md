# **模型 (móxíng) - Model; Mold; Pattern**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **模** (mó): means "model," "pattern," or "mold." Left: **木** (mù, wood) indicates material (molds were often made of wood); right: **莫** (mò), provides sound.  
- **型** (xíng): means "model," "type," or "form." Left: **土** (tǔ, earth/ground) at the bottom, suggesting shape or form; right: **刑** (xíng, punishment/pattern) at the top, gives sound and shape association.

**Examples**:  
- 这是一个飞机模型。(Zhè shì yí gè fēijī móxíng.) - This is an airplane model.  
- 我们需要建立一个新的模型。(Wǒmen xūyào jiànlì yí gè xīn de móxíng.) - We need to build a new model.  
- 这个数学模型很复杂。(Zhège shùxué móxíng hěn fùzá.) - This mathematical model is very complex.

**Usage Notes**:  
**模型** (móxíng) is used for both physical models (like toys or prototypes) and abstract models (like mathematical, computer, or theoretical models).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of **模** (mó) (wood + mold) as a wooden mold used to shape things, and **型** (xíng) as the form (shape/grounded in earth) that comes from the mold - together, they form "model."
