- **验 (yàn)**: Means "to test," "verify." *Left*: 马(mǎ, horse radical), *right*: 佥(qiān, phonetic component).

**Examples**:  
- 他有很多工作经验 (Tā yǒu hěn duō gōngzuò jīngyàn) - He has a lot of work experience.  
- 学习要靠实践经验 (Xuéxí yào kào shíjiàn jīngyàn) - Learning relies on practical experience.  
- 你有什么经验可以分享？(Nǐ yǒu shénme jīngyàn kěyǐ fēnxiǎng?) - Do you have any experience to share?

**Usage Notes**:  
- 经验 (jīngyàn) is a noun, often used with verbs like 有 (yǒu, to have), 获得 (huòdé, to gain), or 积累 (jīlěi, to accumulate).  
- Refers to practical knowledge gained through doing, not just theory.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 想象经验 (jīngyàn)是一根丝线 (sīxiàn, thread) 经过马 (mǎ, horse) 的考验 (kǎoyàn, test)-只有经过实践，才有经验。  
(Imagine experience as a thread passing a horse's test-you need practice to gain experience!)
