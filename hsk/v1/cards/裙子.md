# **裙子 (qúnzi) - Skirt/Dress**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 裙 (qún): Top is 衤(yī) "clothing radical" indicating garment; right is 君(jūn) meaning "gentleman," but here it’s phonetic.  
- 子 (zi): Means "child" or is used as a noun suffix; single character with top-horizontal stroke, then a short vertical, finishing with a bottom portion like a "z."

**Examples**:  
- 她穿了一条漂亮的裙子。(Tā chuānle yì tiáo piàoliang de qúnzi.) - She wore a beautiful skirt.  
- 这条裙子很合适。(Zhè tiáo qúnzi hěn héshì.) - This skirt fits well.  
- 我喜欢红色的裙子。(Wǒ xǐhuan hóngsè de qúnzi.) - I like red skirts.

**Usage Notes**:  
裙子 (qúnzi) is a general word for "skirt" or "dress." Use 条 (tiáo) as the measure word.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine 衤(yī) as "clothing" and 君(jūn) "gentleman": a gentleman might give clothing as a gift-like a skirt! 子(zi) is a common item suffix.
