# **运算 (yùn suàn) - Calculation; Operation**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 运 (yùn): Movement, transport. Left: 辶 (chuò, "walk" radical) indicates movement. Right: 云 (yún, meaning "cloud"), suggests movement as in clouds moving.  
- 算 (suàn): Calculate. Top: ⺮ (zhú, "bamboo" radical), as bamboo was used for counting rods. Bottom: 目 (mù, "eye") + 廾 (gǒng, "two hands") suggests seeing/counting with hands.

**Examples**:  
- 我在做数学运算。 (Wǒ zài zuò shùxué yùn suàn.) - I am doing math calculations.  
- 计算机能快速运算。 (Jìsuànjī néng kuàisù yùn suàn.) - Computers can calculate quickly.  
- 运算结果是什么？ (Yùn suàn jiéguǒ shì shénme?) - What is the result of the calculation?

**Usage Notes**:  
- 运算 (yùn suàn) is often used for mathematical or logical operations, not for day-to-day arithmetic like counting money.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 运 (yùn) = move + cloud: think of ideas moving like clouds.  
- 算 (suàn): Bamboo rods in hands → calculating numbers.  
- 运算 (yùn suàn): Move (process) + calculate = performing calculations or operations.
