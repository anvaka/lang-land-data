# **成语 (chéngyǔ) - Idiom; set phrase**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **成** (chéng): "to become", "to complete". Radical: 戈 (gē) "halberd" on the right, with 丁 (dīng) "nail" on the top left.  
- **语** (yǔ): "language", "speech". Radical: 讠(yán) "speech" on the left, 各 (gè) "each" on the right.

**Examples**:  
- 我们在学习中文成语。(Wǒmen zài xuéxí Zhōngwén chéngyǔ.) - We are studying Chinese idioms.  
- 他用成语来表达意思。(Tā yòng chéngyǔ lái biǎodá yìsi.) - He uses idioms to express his meaning.  
- 你会几个成语？(Nǐ huì jǐ gè chéngyǔ?) - How many idioms do you know?

**Usage Notes**:  
**成语**(chéngyǔ) usually refers to four-character idioms with historical or literary origins. Used in both formal writing and speech for vivid expression.

**Memory Aids**:  
**成**(chéng): "to become"-think of an action being completed.  
**语**(yǔ): "speech"-the left 讠(yán) hints at "words".  
So, **成语**(chéngyǔ) = "completed words" = "idioms."
