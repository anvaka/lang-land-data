# **频率 (pínlǜ) - Frequency**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **频** (pín): Left is "页" (yè, page/head radical), right is "步" (bù, step). Suggests repeating steps or actions.  
- **率** (lǜ): Top is "冫" (bīng, ice radical), middle is "玄" (xuán, profound), bottom is "十" (shí, ten). Generally means "rate" or "ratio".

**Examples**:  
- 这个声音的**频率**(pínlǜ)很高。(Zhège shēngyīn de pínlǜ hěn gāo.) - The frequency of this sound is very high.  
- 你运动的**频率**(pínlǜ)是多少？(Nǐ yùndòng de pínlǜ shì duōshǎo?) - How often do you exercise?  
- 他最近提高了工作**频率**(pínlǜ)。(Tā zuìjìn tígāo le gōngzuò pínlǜ.) - He recently increased his work frequency.

**Usage Notes**:  
**频率**(pínlǜ) is both scientific (physics, sound, waves) and general (habits, activities). Combine with adjectives like 高(gāo, high) or 低(dī, low).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think "**频**(pín)" = "repeated steps," "**率**(lǜ)" = "rate."  
Recall: How "frequently" (频率 pínlǜ) do you "step" (步 bù) up your "rate" (率 lǜ)?
