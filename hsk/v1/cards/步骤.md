# **步骤 (bùzhòu) - Step; procedure**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **步** (bù): Means "step" or "walk." Radical "止" (zhǐ, stop) at the bottom with "少" (shǎo, few) at the top.  
- **骤** (zhòu): Means "sudden" or "step (as in sequence)." Left side is "马" (mǎ, horse), right side is "聚" (jù, gather) without the "耳" (ěr, ear) radical.

**Examples**:  
- 请按步骤操作。(Qǐng àn bùzhòu cāozuò.) - Please operate according to the steps.  
- 下一步骤是什么？(Xià yī bùzhòu shì shénme?) - What is the next step?  
- 每个步骤都很重要。(Měi gè bùzhòu dōu hěn zhòngyào.) - Every step is important.

**Usage Notes**:  
**步骤** (bùzhòu) is used for procedures, instructions, or sequential actions. Often followed by verbs like **操作** (cāozuò, operate), **完成** (wánchéng, finish).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of **步** (bù, step) as taking a physical step, and **骤** (zhòu) as steps that follow in quick succession, like a horse's galloping-many steps in a sequence.
