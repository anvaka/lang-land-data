# **眯 (mī) - to squint; to narrow (the eyes)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 眯 (mī):
  - Radical: 目 (mù) "eye" on the left
  - Right: 米 (mǐ) "rice", here indicating sound and contributing to the meaning related to the eyes

**Examples**:  
- 她眯(mī)着眼看东西。(Tā mī zhe yǎn kàn dōngxi.) - She squints to look at things.  
- 他太阳下喜欢眯(mī)眼睛。(Tā tàiyáng xià xǐhuān mī yǎnjing.) - He likes to narrow his eyes in the sun.  
- 小猫眯(mī)着眼睛睡觉。(Xiǎo māo mī zhe yǎnjing shuìjiào.) - The kitten sleeps with its eyes squinted.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 眯(mī) is commonly used with 着(zhe) to indicate a continuous action: 眯(mī)着眼(yǎn) "squinting."  
- Be careful: 眯(mí) (different tone) can mean “to nap,” but is less common.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think: "eye" (目(mù)) + squint so much you can hardly see a "grain of rice" (米(mǐ))!
