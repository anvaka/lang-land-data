# **颁发 (bānfā) - Award; Issue (an official document, prize, etc.)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **颁** (bān): "to confer, to issue". Left: "页" (yè) means "page/head" (right side), Top-left: "分" (fēn) means "to divide". Originally related to dividing and giving out by authority.  
- **发** (fā): "to send out, to issue". Top: "又" (yòu) means "again/hand", Bottom: "友" (yǒu) means "friend" without the right stroke, signifying dispatching or distributing.

**Examples**:  
- 学校颁发(bānfā)了毕业证书(bìyè zhèngshū)。 (Xuéxiào bānfā le bìyè zhèngshū.) - The school awarded graduation certificates.  
- 他被颁发(bānfā)了荣誉称号(róngyù chēnghào)。 (Tā bèi bānfā le róngyù chēnghào.) - He was awarded an honorary title.  
- 政府颁发(bānfā)新政策(xīn zhèngcè)。 (Zhèngfǔ bānfā xīn zhèngcè.) - The government issued a new policy.

**Usage Notes**:  
Use 颁发(bānfā) for formal, official awards, certificates, policies, or honors-not for giving physical objects like food or presents in daily life.

**Memory Aids**:  
颁(bān) looks like "pages being divided and handed out" (think of official documents). 发(fā) is "sending out"-so 颁发(bānfā) = "formally sending out" something important.
