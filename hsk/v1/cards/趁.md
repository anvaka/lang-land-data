# **趁 (chèn) - to take advantage of; while**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 趁 (chèn): The radical on the left is 走 (zǒu, “walk”, "run", left side), indicating movement. The right side is 朕 (zhèn), an ancient word for "I" (the emperor), suggesting taking an opportunity or moving when there is a chance.

**Examples**:  
- 趁 (chèn) 现在 (xiànzài) 赶快 (gǎnkuài) 走 (zǒu)！(Chèn xiànzài gǎnkuài zǒu!) - Leave quickly while you can!  
- 趁 (chèn) 雨 (yǔ) 停 (tíng) 了 (le)，我们 (wǒmen) 出去 (chūqù) 吧 (ba)。(Chèn yǔ tíng le, wǒmen chūqù ba.) - Let's go out while the rain has stopped.  
- 他 (tā) 趁 (chèn) 我 (wǒ) 不 (bù) 注意 (zhùyì) 偷 (tōu) 了 (le) 东西 (dōngxi)。 (Tā chèn wǒ bù zhùyì tōu le dōngxi.) - He stole something while I wasn’t paying attention.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 趁 (chèn) is a preposition, used before a noun or a clause to express "taking advantage of (a time/opportunity)".  
- Common pattern: 趁 (chèn) + time/opportunity + action.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine someone 走 (zǒu, walking/moving) quickly to take a rare opportunity-when you see 趁 (chèn), think of moving immediately to take advantage!
