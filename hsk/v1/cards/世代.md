# **世代 (shìdài) - Generation; Era**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **世** (shì): "generation; world". Radical at top: 十 (shí, "ten"); below is 廿 (niàn, "twenty"), evoking passage of time.  
- **代** (dài): "era; to replace". Left: 亻(rén, "person" radical), right: 弋 (yì, "shoot/replace"), suggesting people replacing one another.

**Examples**:  
- 不同世代有不同的观点。(Bùtóng shìdài yǒu bùtóng de guāndiǎn.) - Different generations have different viewpoints.  
- 这一世代喜欢科技产品。(Zhè yī shìdài xǐhuān kējì chǎnpǐn.) - This generation likes tech products.  
- 传统在世代之间传承。(Chuántǒng zài shìdài zhījiān chuánchéng.) - Traditions are passed between generations.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **世代**(shìdài) commonly refers to groups by age (e.g., 年轻世代 (niánqīng shìdài), "younger generation") or historical eras.  
- Can also mean "generation after generation", as in "世代相传" (shìdài xiāng chuán, "passed down through generations").

**Memory Aids**:  
- **世**(shì): "World/time" stacked with tens + twenty = a long span.  
- **代**(dài): "Person" + "replace" = one person after another.  
- "世代" (shìdài): Think “eras” (世(shì)) are made by people taking turns (代(dài)).
