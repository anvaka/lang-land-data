# **下午 (xiàwǔ) - afternoon**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 下 (xià): "down, below". The radical 一 (yī) "one" is on top, with a short line 丨 (gǔn) beneath it, representing "below the line".  
- 午 (wǔ): "noon". The top stroke (horizontal), with lower strokes crossing underneath, symbolizing the sun at its highest point.

**Examples**:  
- 我下午(xiàwǔ)有课(yǒu kè)。 (Wǒ xiàwǔ yǒu kè.) - I have class in the afternoon.  
- 下午(xiàwǔ)三点见(sān diǎn jiàn)。 (Xiàwǔ sān diǎn jiàn.) - See you at 3 in the afternoon.  
- 你下午(xiàwǔ)做什么(zuò shénme)？ (Nǐ xiàwǔ zuò shénme?) - What are you doing this afternoon?

**Usage Notes**:  
下午(xiàwǔ) indicates the period after noon (中午 zhōngwǔ) and before evening (晚上 wǎnshang), typically from 12:00 to 6:00 PM; often used as a time phrase before verbs.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "下(xià)" = down (sun going down), "午(wǔ)" = noon ⇒ after noon = afternoon.
