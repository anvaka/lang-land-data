# **还原 (huán yuán) - to restore; to reduce (in chemistry)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **还 (huán)**: Left: "辶 (chuò)" radical (walk) at the left, Right: "不 (bù)" (not) at the right; originally means "to return".  
- **原 (yuán)**: Top: "厂 (hǎn)" (cliff), Middle: "白 (bái)" (white), Bottom: "小 (xiǎo)" (small); means "origin" or "beginning".

**Examples**:  
- 请 (qǐng) 还原 (huán yuán) 现场 (xiàn chǎng)。 - Please restore the scene.  
- 水 (shuǐ) 可以 (kě yǐ) 还原 (huán yuán) 二氧化碳 (èr yǎng huà tàn)。 - Water can reduce carbon dioxide.  
- 他 (tā) 努力 (nǔ lì) 还原 (huán yuán) 真相 (zhēn xiàng)。 - He tries hard to restore the truth.

**Usage Notes**:  
还原 (huán yuán) is used for returning something to its original state. In daily speech, it means "restore" or "reproduce (a scene)". In chemistry, it means "reduce" (opposite of oxidation).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: 还 (huán) is "return" + 原 (yuán) is "origin" → "return to the origin" = restore.
