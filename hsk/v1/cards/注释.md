**Usage Notes**:  
注释 (zhùshì) is mainly used for written explanations of words, phrases, or text. It often appears in academic or instructional materials. The verb is 注释 (zhùshì) (to annotate), and the noun is also 注释 (zhùshì) (annotation/commentary).

**Memory Aids**:  
注 (zhù) means "to focus on" → you're focusing on the text;  
释 (shì) means "to explain" → you're explaining it.  
So 注释 (zhùshì) = focus + explain = annotation.
