# **掉 (diào) - to fall; to drop; to lose**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 掉 (diào): Left side "扌" (shǒu, hand radical, left; indicates action with the hand), right side "卓" (zhuó, distinguished, right; phonetic component).

**Examples**:  
- 他的钱包掉了。 (Tā de qiánbāo diào le.) - His wallet fell/lost.  
- 眼镜掉在地上了。 (Yǎnjìng diào zài dìshàng le.) - The glasses dropped on the ground.  
- 叶子都掉下来了。 (Yèzi dōu diào xiàlai le.) - All the leaves have fallen.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 掉 (diào) often follows a verb to indicate something is lost or fell off, e.g., 掉下来 (diào xiàlái, to fall down).  
- Can be both transitive (drop something) and intransitive (fall off), depending on context.

**Memory Aids**:  
- “扌” (shǒu) left = hand, think of a hand letting go, causing something to “掉” (diào) - to drop or fall.
