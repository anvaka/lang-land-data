**麻醉** (má zuì) is used as both a noun ("anesthesia") and verb ("to anesthetize"). Often seen in medical contexts. The person performing 麻醉 (má zuì) is called **麻醉师** (má zuì shī, anesthetist).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think "麻" (má, numb) + "醉" (zuì, drunk): Anesthesia makes you numb and a bit like feeling "drunk."  
"麻醉" (má zuì) = numb (麻, má) + intoxicated (醉, zuì): numb from being dosed.
