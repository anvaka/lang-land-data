- 变 (biàn): "to change"-Top: 亦 (yì, also), Bottom: 亻(rén, person radical). Suggests a person experiencing change.  
- 故 (gù): "happening; reason"-Left: 攵 (pū, action radical), Right: 古 (gǔ, ancient). Implies an event from the past or cause due to action.

**Usage Notes**:  
变故 (biàn gù) is typically used for sudden, often negative, unexpected major events (accidents, losses, family misfortunes); formal and not used for trivial matters.

**Memory Aids**:  
变 (biàn): "Bend" for "change".  
故 (gù): "Go-to" past reasons or old causes.  
Together: When something "changes (biàn)" due to an "old reason (gù)", it's an unexpected incident!
