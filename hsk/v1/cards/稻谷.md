# **稻谷 (dào gǔ) - Rice (unhusked paddy)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 稻 (dào): "rice plant." Left: 禾 (hé, "grain," radical for crops); right: 舀 (yǎo, "scoop"), representing older ways of collecting grain.  
- 谷 (gǔ): "valley" or "grain." Top: 八 (bā, "eight"); middle: 口 (kǒu, "mouth"); bottom: a variant of shape meaning "grain." Represents a valley where grains grow.

**Examples**:  
- 稻谷(dào gǔ) 是重要的农作物。(dào gǔ shì zhòng yào de nóng zuò wù.) - Rice (paddy) is an important crop.  
- 秋天收割稻谷(dào gǔ)。(qiū tiān shōu gē dào gǔ.) - The rice (paddy) is harvested in autumn.  
- 稻谷(dào gǔ) 变成大米后才能吃。(dào gǔ biàn chéng dà mǐ hòu cái néng chī.) - The rice (paddy) must become white rice to be eaten.

**Usage Notes**:  
稻谷(dào gǔ) refers specifically to rice in its raw, unthreshed form (with husk); not cooked rice or milled rice (大米 dà mǐ).
