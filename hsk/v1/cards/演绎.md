# **演绎 (yǎn yì) - Deduce; expound; to develop (a theory)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **演** (yǎn): Left - “⺡” (three dots/“water” radical, left side) often relates to liquid/action. Right - “寅”(yín), meaning “perform, act out” here.  
- **绎** (yì): Left - “纟”(sī, “silk” radical, left side), often suggests “thread; connection.” Right - “卖”(mài, “sell”), contributes sound meaning.

**Examples**:  
- 这个理论是通过演绎(yǎn yì)得出的。(Zhè ge lǐlùn shì tōngguò yǎn yì déchū de.) - This theory was deduced.  
- 老师演绎(yǎn yì)了这首诗。(Lǎoshī yǎn yì le zhè shǒu shī.) - The teacher explained (expounded upon) this poem.  
- 他善于演绎(yǎn yì)复杂的问题。(Tā shànyú yǎn yì fùzá de wèntí.) - He is good at deducing complex problems.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 演绎(yǎn yì) is often used with logic, reasoning, or developing explanations.  
- In contrast to 归纳(guī nà, induct), 演绎(yǎn yì) means reasoning from general to specific.  
- Can also mean “to perform” (like a role/theory) in some contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 演(yǎn): Imagine water (⺡) flowing as you perform (act/move).  
- 绎(yì): Silky (纟) threads connect ideas and you “untangle” by explaining.
