# **知道 (zhī dào) - to know**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 知 (zhī): "to know." Left side is 矢 (shǐ, "arrow") and right side is 口 (kǒu, "mouth")-suggesting conveying knowledge with words like an arrow.  
- 道 (dào): "way," "path," or "method." Left side is 辶 (chuò, "walk" radical) and right side is 首 (shǒu, "head")-implies leading the way.

**Examples**:  
- 我知道了。(wǒ zhī dào le.) - I know (now).  
- 你知道他是谁吗？(nǐ zhī dào tā shì shéi ma?) - Do you know who he is?  
- 她不知道怎么做。(tā bù zhī dào zěn me zuò.) - She doesn't know how to do it.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 知道 (zhī dào) is used for facts or information, not for knowing people (which uses 认识 (rèn shi)).  
- Can be followed by content (e.g. 知道什么 (zhī dào shén me) - know what).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine an arrow (矢 (shǐ)) in a mouth (口 (kǒu)) "delivers the truth" (知 (zhī)), leading you down the path (道 (dào)) of knowledge.
