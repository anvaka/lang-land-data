# **赤道 (chìdào) - Equator**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 赤 (chì): Means "red." The radical on top is 土 (tǔ, earth), and below is 小 (xiǎo, small). Historically relates to "bare" or "earth-colored" (and later, "red").  
- 道 (dào): Means "way," "path," or "route." The left is the 辶 (chuò, movement) radical, representing movement/walking. The right is 首 (shǒu, head), picturing a path to follow.

**Examples**:  
- 赤道 (chìdào)穿过多个国家。(chìdào chuānguò duōgè guójiā.) - The equator passes through many countries.  
- 新加坡 (Xīnjiāpō)靠近赤道 (chìdào)。 (Xīnjiāpō kàojìn chìdào.) - Singapore is near the equator.  
- 赤道 (chìdào)上总是很热。(chìdào shàng zǒngshì hěn rè.) - It's always hot on the equator.

**Usage Notes**:  
赤道 (chìdào) is a specific geographic term and is generally used in scientific or geographic contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think "赤 (chì, red)" for the hot, sunburned equator, and "道 (dào, road)" for the path around the earth-so 赤道 (chìdào) is the "red/hot road" around the middle of the globe!
