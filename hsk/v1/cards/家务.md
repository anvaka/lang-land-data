# **家务 (jiāwù) - Housework, Household chores**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 家 (jiā): "home, family"; roof radical 宀 (mián) on top, pig 豕 (shǐ) underneath-originally indicated a pig under a roof, symbolizing a household.  
- 务 (wù): "affair, task, business"; grass radical 力 (lì, "strength") on bottom, component 夂 (zhǐ, "go") on top, showing energetic work.

**Examples**:  
- 我 (wǒ)每天 (měitiān)都 (dōu)要 (yào)做 (zuò)家务 (jiāwù)。 (I have to do housework every day.)  
- 你 (nǐ)会 (huì)做 (zuò)哪些 (nǎxiē)家务 (jiāwù)？ (Which household chores can you do?)  
- 他 (tā)不 (bù)喜欢 (xǐhuān)做 (zuò)家务 (jiāwù)。 (He doesn't like doing housework.)

**Usage Notes**:  
家务 (jiāwù) is mainly used for regular household tasks (cleaning, washing, cooking). If specifying a task, add the specific activity (e.g., 洗衣 (xǐyī), “laundry”).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: 家 (jiā) is your home, and 务 (wù) sounds like “work”-so 家务 (jiāwù) = work around the home.
