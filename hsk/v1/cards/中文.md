# **中文 (zhōng wén) - Chinese (language)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 中 (zhōng): "middle, central". The outer box represents a boundary; the vertical stroke in the center shows something positioned in the middle.  
- 文 (wén): "language, script, literature". Top part is "𠆢" (cover), under which is the shape for "tie threads"-originally showing woven patterns, now meaning culture or writing.

**Examples**:  
- 我会说中文。(Wǒ huì shuō zhōng wén.) - I can speak Chinese.  
- 你喜欢学中文吗？(Nǐ xǐ huān xué zhōng wén ma?) - Do you like to study Chinese?  
- 中文很有趣。(Zhōng wén hěn yǒu qù.) - Chinese is very interesting.

**Usage Notes**:  
中文 (zhōng wén) refers specifically to the Chinese language (written or spoken), not ethnically Chinese people or anything Chinese in general (where 中国 (zhōng guó) or 中国人 (zhōng guó rén) would be used).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "中 (zhōng): middle" + "文 (wén): language" → The language from the "Middle Kingdom" (China)!
