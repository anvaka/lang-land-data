# **牵扯 (qiān chě) - Involve; implicate; drag in**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 牵 (qiān): "to pull," "to lead." Left: 牛 (niú, cow) radical suggests pulling cattle. Right: 干 (gān, dry/handle) gives phonetic cue, sits on the right side.  
- 扯 (chě): "to pull," "to tear." Left: 扌(shǒu, hand) radical (hand actions) on the left. Right: early form of the character "车" (chē, vehicle) on the right, lending phonetic value.

**Examples**:  
- 这件事牵扯(qiān chě)到很多人。(Zhè jiàn shì qiān chě dào hěn duō rén.) - This matter involves many people.  
- 我不想被牵扯(qiān chě)进他们的争论。(Wǒ bù xiǎng bèi qiān chě jìn tāmen de zhēnglùn.) - I don't want to be dragged into their argument.  
- 案件牵扯(qiān chě)到几个部门。(Ànjiàn qiān chě dào jǐ gè bùmén.) - The case implicates several departments.

**Usage Notes**:  
牵扯(qiān chě) usually implies being *unwillingly* involved or entangled, often in trouble, disputes, or complex matters.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine someone using their hand (扌shǒu) pulling a cow (牛niú), showing "牵(qiān)" and "扯(chě)" both mean pulling-together, they reinforce the sense of being "dragged in."
