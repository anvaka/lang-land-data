# **吨 (dūn) - ton (metric ton, 1000 kg)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 吨 (dūn): Left = 口 (kǒu, "mouth" radical, left side). Right = 屯 (tún, "station" or "to station" in military sense, right side; top is "dot," bottom is "vertical box with two horizontal lines"). Originally a unit of weight, now means "ton."

**Usage Notes**:  
- 吨 (dūn) is a measure word (量词 liàngcí) for weight, equal to 1000 kilograms.  
- Used mainly in scientific, industrial, and logistical contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think: "吨 (dūn)" sounds a bit like "ton" in English-both mean the same heavy weight!  
- Imagine a giant "口 (kǒu, mouth)" needing a ton of food-a big appetite!
