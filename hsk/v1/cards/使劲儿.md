# **使劲儿 (shǐ jìn r) - to exert oneself, to use force**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 使 (shǐ): to make, to use. Left side is 亻(rén, "person" radical) on the left and 史(shǐ, "history") on the right.  
- 劲 (jìn): strength, energy. Left is 力(lì, "power" radical), right is 巠(jīng, “path”).  
- 儿 (r): retroflex ending, often adds a colloquial or northern flavor.

**Examples**:  
- 请使劲儿推门。(Qǐng shǐ jìn r tuī mén.) - Please push the door hard.  
- 他干活总是使劲儿。(Tā gàn huó zǒng shì shǐ jìn r.) - He always works with all his strength.  
- 孩子们比赛时使劲儿跑。(Hái zi men bǐ sài shí shǐ jìn r pǎo.) - The children ran as hard as they could during the race.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 使劲儿 (shǐ jìn r) is informal; northern Chinese often add 儿 (r) for colloquial flavor.  
- Used as an action: “使劲儿 + verb”, or as a standalone verb meaning “exert (force/effort)”.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 使 (shǐ, "to make") + 劲 (jìn, "strength") = "make strength" → use force!  
- 儿 (r) adds a punchy, energetic sound-just like you need energy to 使劲儿 (shǐ jìn r)!
