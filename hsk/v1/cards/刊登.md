# **刊登 (kān dēng) - Publish; To print (in a publication)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **刊** (kān): means "publish" or "cut/carve." Left: **刂** (dāo) "knife" on the right, indicating cutting; right: **干** (gān) "to do."  
- **登** (dēng): means "ascend" or "to post." Bottom: **豆** (dòu) "bean" (ancient sacrificial vessel); top: **癶** (bō), "spread feet," showing stepping up.

**Examples**:  
- 这条消息已经刊登(kān dēng)在报纸上了。(Zhè tiáo xiāoxī yǐjīng kāndēng zài bàozhǐ shàng le.) - This news has already been published in the newspaper.  
- 杂志会刊登(kān dēng)学术论文。(Zázhì huì kāndēng xuéshù lùnwén.) - The magazine will publish academic papers.  
- 他希望他的照片被刊登(kān dēng)出来。(Tā xīwàng tā de zhàopiàn bèi kāndēng chūlái.) - He hopes his photo will be published.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 刊登(kān dēng) is formal, mostly used for newspapers, magazines, and official publications-not for online casual posts.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 刊(kān) with the "knife" hints at carving words onto pages; 登(dēng) shows "climbing up"-think of your article climbing into a publication!
