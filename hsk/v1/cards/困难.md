# **困难 (kùn nán) - Difficulty; difficulty; hardship**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 困 (kùn): Means "trapped, stuck". The box (囗 wéi, enclosure radical) surrounds 木 (mù, wood) inside - imagine a tree trapped inside a box, unable to escape.  
- 难 (nán): Means "difficult". Top is ⿱⺧ (niú, cow radical), bottom is 又 (yòu, again/hand). Cows can be hard to manage; controlling them is "difficult".

**Examples**:  
- 他遇到了困难。(Tā yùdào le kùnnán.) - He encountered difficulties.  
- 学中文并不困难。(Xué Zhōngwén bìng bù kùnnán.) - Learning Chinese is not difficult.  
- 我们一起克服困难。(Wǒmen yìqǐ kèfú kùnnán.) - Let's overcome difficulties together.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 困难 (kùn nán) is a noun, often used as "遇到困难" (yùdào kùnnán, encounter difficulties).  
- Can also describe something as "很困难" (hěn kùnnán, very difficult).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think of a tree 困 (kùn) inside a box: "trapped" = difficulty.  
- "Nán" (难) hints at "not-easy" with stubborn cows - handling cows is "hard".
