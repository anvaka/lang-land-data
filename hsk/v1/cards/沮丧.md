# **沮丧 (jǔ sàng) - Depressed, Frustrated**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 沮 (jǔ): Left is the “water” radical 氵(shuǐ) indicating emotion/state; right is “且” (qiě) meaning “moreover.” Implies being hindered, blocked, or unhappy.  
- 丧 (sàng): Top is “丷” (bā), bottom is “桑” (sāng, mulberry tree). Originally referenced mourning/loss; now means “discouraged” or “dejected.”

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 感到 (gǎndào) 很 (hěn) 沮丧 (jǔ sàng)。- He feels very depressed.  
- 失败 (shībài) 让 (ràng) 她 (tā) 感到 (gǎndào) 沮丧 (jǔ sàng)。- Failure made her frustrated.  
- 不要 (bùyào) 沮丧 (jǔ sàng)，一切 (yīqiè) 都 (dōu) 会 (huì) 好 (hǎo) 起来 (qǐlái)。- Don’t be depressed; everything will get better.

**Usage Notes**:  
沮丧 (jǔ sàng) describes deep negative emotions, stronger than 失望 (shīwàng, disappointed); often used for mood or mental state. Functions as adjective or verb.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine water (氵shuǐ) washing over and mulberry trees (桑 sàng) wilting-both characters suggest losing energy or spirit.  
- “沮” (jǔ) sounds like “juice”-losing your juice (energy) leads to “丧” (sàng, loss).
