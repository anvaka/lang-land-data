# **操练 (cāo liàn) - Practice; Drill**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **操 (cāo):** Left: 扌(shǒu, "hand" radical), right: 喿(zào, "chirping" or noisy). Means "to operate," "to exercise," or "to drill." The "hand" radical (扌) on the left suggests actions done by hand.  
- **练 (liàn):** Left: 纟(mì, "silk" radical), right: 东(dōng, "east"). Originally "to twist silk repeatedly," leading to "to practice" or "train."

**Examples**:  
- 我们每天都要操练中文。(Wǒmen měitiān dū yào cāoliàn zhōngwén.) - We practice Chinese every day.  
- 士兵们正在操练队形。(Shìbīngmen zhèngzài cāoliàn duìxíng.) - The soldiers are drilling their formations.  
- 老师让我们操练发音。(Lǎoshī ràng wǒmen cāoliàn fāyīn.) - The teacher asks us to practice pronunciation.

**Usage Notes**:  
操练 (cāoliàn) is often used in contexts involving repeated or systematic practice, especially with skills, drills, or military training. More formal than 练习 (liànxí), often implying structured repetition.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine your "hand" (扌 shǒu) actively practicing (操 cāo) weaving silk threads (纟 mì) over and over-that’s 练 (liàn), to practice!
