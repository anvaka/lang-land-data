# **面包 (miànbāo) - bread**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 面 (miàn): "flour" or "face". Radical: 面 (miàn) (full character). Top to bottom structure. Originally means “face” but extended to "flour" in food contexts.  
- 包 (bāo): "wrap" or "package". Radical: 勹 (bāo) (top/left wrapping component), 包 (bāo) (full character). Visual of something wrapped.

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢吃面包。(Wǒ xǐhuān chī miànbāo.) - I like to eat bread.  
- 这里的面包很新鲜。(Zhèlǐ de miànbāo hěn xīnxiān.) - The bread here is very fresh.  
- 请给我两块面包。(Qǐng gěi wǒ liǎng kuài miànbāo.) - Please give me two pieces of bread.

**Usage Notes**:  
面包 (miànbāo) refers to Western-style leavened bread, not traditional Chinese steamed buns (those are called 馒头 mán​tóu).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "面 (miàn) (flour) 包 (bāo) (wrapped)"-bread is flour wrapped and baked!  
The character 包 (bāo) looks like a package, just like bread is a packaged food.
