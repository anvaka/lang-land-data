# **恶心 (ě xin) - Nauseous; Disgusting**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **恶 (è/ě)**: Top has "亚 (yà)" (second), bottom is "心 (xīn)" (heart). As "ě," it means "nauseated." Radical: "心 (xīn)" at the bottom, related to feeling.  
- **心 (xīn)**: Means "heart." Written as three dots (indicating feelings), often at bottom.

**Examples**:  
- 这道菜让我很恶心。(Zhè dào cài ràng wǒ hěn ě xin.) - This dish makes me feel nauseous.  
- 他的话太恶心了！(Tā de huà tài ě xin le!) - His words are so disgusting!  
- 我一闻到那个味道就恶心。(Wǒ yī wén dào nà gè wèidào jiù ě xin.) - I feel nauseous as soon as I smell that odor.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **恶心 (ě xin)** is both an adjective ("disgusting") and verb ("to feel nauseous").  
- In speech, "我恶心了 (wǒ ě xin le)" means "I feel sick."

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine your "heart (心 xīn)" feels "bad (恶 è)" → "nauseous" or "disgusted."  
- The "心 (xīn)" at the bottom: it's your heart (feelings) being affected.
