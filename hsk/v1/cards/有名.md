# **有名 (yǒu míng) - famous; well-known**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **有 (yǒu)**: means "to have" or "there is." On the left, the "meat/moon" radical (⺼/月, yuè) and on the right,  "again/repetition" component (又, yòu).  
- **名 (míng)**: means "name" or "fame." The top has "evening" radical (夕, xī), bottom has "mouth" radical (口, kǒu), relating to "making one’s name known at night by speaking."

**Usage Notes**:  
有名(yǒu míng) is an adjective. Usually precedes nouns, e.g. 有名(yǒu míng)的(的)公司(gōngsī) (famous company). It can also be used after subjects without 的(de): 他(tā)很(hěn)有名(yǒu míng)。

**Memory Aids**:  
有(yǒu) means "to have", so you "have a name" (名 míng), making you "famous." Think: "If you ‘have a name’, you are well-known."
