# **舒畅 (shū chàng) - Comfortable; Relaxed; Unrestrained**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **舒** (shū): Left = 宀 (mián, "roof" radical, top), Right = 予 (yǔ, "give", right); overall means "to stretch out, relax".  
- **畅** (chàng): Left = 氵(shuǐ, "water" radical, left), Right = 昜 (yáng, "bright" above with "sun" over "again", right); means "free and easy, smooth".

**Usage Notes**:  
**舒畅** (shū chàng) is used to describe a relaxed or pleasant physical/mental state. It’s often about emotions or general well-being, less about physical objects.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine **舒** (shū) as someone stretching (under a roof) to relax, and **畅** (chàng) as water (on the left) flowing smoothly into brightness-smoothly and freely, just like feeling refreshed.
