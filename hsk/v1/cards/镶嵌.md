# **镶嵌 (xiāng qiàn) - Inlay; Embed**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **镶** (xiāng): Left = 钅(jīn, "metal" radical, left), right = 乡(xiāng, "village", right). Often relates to metalwork: "镶" refers to mounting or inlaying metal or other materials.  
- **嵌** (qiàn): Top = 山(shān, "mountain" radical), bottom = 欠(qiàn, "lack, yawn"). "嵌" means to embed or set into, as if wedged into a mountain.

**Examples**:  
- 这枚戒指上镶嵌(xiāng qiàn)着钻石。(Zhè méi jièzhǐ shàng xiāngqiàn zhe zuànshí.) - This ring is inlaid with diamonds.  
- 台面镶嵌(xiāng qiàn)了彩色瓷砖。(Táimiàn xiāngqiàn le cǎisè cízhuān.) - The tabletop is inlaid with colored tiles.  
- 软件中可以镶嵌(xiāng qiàn)图片或视频。(Ruǎnjiàn zhōng kěyǐ xiāngqiàn túpiàn huò shìpín.) - Images or videos can be embedded in the software.

**Usage Notes**:  
Mainly used for physical "inlay" (jewelry, decoration), but can also describe "embedding" digital content (images, files). Formal or technical tone.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine "metal" (钅 jīn) merged with a "village" (乡 xiāng) to create a decorated item; "mountain" (山 shān) and "lack" (欠 qiàn) together-picture something wedged or set inside a mountain, i.e., embedded.
