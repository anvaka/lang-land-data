# **香蕉 (xiāng jiāo) - Banana**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 香 (xiāng): means "fragrant." The radical 禾 (hé, grain) is on the left, meaning "grain," and the component 曰 (yuē, say/speak) is on the right.  
- 蕉 (jiāo): means "banana" or sometimes "plantain." The 艹 (cǎo, grass) radical is on top, signifying "plant/grass." The character 焦 (jiāo, burnt/charred) is underneath.

**Examples**:

**Usage Notes**:  
- 香蕉 (xiāng jiāo) is a common noun for “banana.”  
- Used both for singular and plural (banana/bananas) without change.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 香 (xiāng, fragrant) + 蕉 (jiāo, plant) = The "fragrant plant" is a banana!  
- Picture the banana’s **yellow skin** (like fragrant grain, 香 xiāng) growing from **grass/leaves** (as in 艹 cǎo on 蕉 jiāo).
