# **原理 (yuánlǐ) - Principle; theory**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **原** (yuán): "origin, source." Left: “厂”(hǎn) radical (cliff) + right top “白”(bái, white) + right bottom “小”(xiǎo, small); together, suggests the origin or original place.  
- **理** (lǐ): "reason, logic." Left: “王”(wáng, king/jade) radical (left); right: “里”(lǐ, inside) (right side). Together: managing or understanding the essence of something.

**Examples**:  
- 我不明白这个原理。(Wǒ bù míngbai zhège yuánlǐ.) - I don't understand this principle.  
- 科学原理很重要。(Kēxué yuánlǐ hěn zhòngyào.) - Scientific principles are very important.  
- 这个机器的工作原理很简单。(Zhège jīqì de gōngzuò yuánlǐ hěn jiǎndān.) - The working principle of this machine is very simple.

**Usage Notes**:  
**原理** (yuánlǐ) is often used in academic or technical contexts to refer to the fundamental theory or mechanism behind something.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of **原** (yuán, origin) + **理** (lǐ, logic): The "origin of logic" = the principle behind something.
