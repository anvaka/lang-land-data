# **雪 (xuě) - snow**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 雪 (xuě): Top: "雨 (yǔ)" radical (rain; indicates weather or precipitation). Bottom: "彐 (jì)" component (resembles a broom; symbolizing sweeping). Together, the idea is "rain swept from the sky"-i.e., falling snow.

**Examples**:  
- 外面下雪了。 (Wàimiàn xià xuě le.) - It's snowing outside.  
- 我喜欢看雪。 (Wǒ xǐhuan kàn xuě.) - I like to watch the snow.  
- 雪很白。 (Xuě hěn bái.) - Snow is very white.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 雪 (xuě) is usually used as a noun.  
- Common in weather phrases (下雪 (xià xuě): to snow).  
- Pairs with verbs like 看 (kàn) (to watch), 踩 (cǎi) (to step on), and 玩 (wán) (to play).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Top "雨 (yǔ)" = rain/clouds; bottom "彐 (jì)" looks like a broom sweeping-think of a broom sweeping snowflakes from a cloud.
