# **喊 (hǎn) - to shout; to yell**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 喊 (hǎn): Left: 口 (kǒu, mouth radical) indicates relation to speaking or sound. Right: 咸 (xián) means "salty" but here acts as the phonetic component.

**Examples**:  
- 她大声喊(她 dàshēng hǎn)：“救命！”(jiùmìng!) - She shouted: "Help!"  
- 孩子在外面喊(háizi zài wàimiàn hǎn)妈妈(māmā)。- The child is calling for their mom outside.  
- 你为什么喊(nǐ wèishéme hǎn)那么大声(nàme dàshēng)？- Why are you shouting so loudly?

**Usage Notes**:  
喊(hǎn) is often used for loud or urgent calls. Can be followed by words like "出来(chūlái, come out)" or a person's name.

**Memory Aids**:  
Picture a 口(kǒu, mouth) on the left shouting so hard that it becomes "salty" (咸(xián)) with effort!
