# **穿 (chuān) - to wear; to penetrate; to pass through**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 穿 (chuān): Top-穴 (xué, “cave/roof” radical) suggests something inside or under cover; Bottom-牙 (yá, “tooth”), here as a phonetic and also resembles an object passing through an opening. Together: the act of passing through something (like putting clothes on, or penetrating).

**Examples**:  
- 我穿( wǒ chuān )衣服( yīfú )。 (Wǒ chuān yīfú.) - I wear clothes.  
- 他穿( tā chuān )过( guò )了( le )隧道( suìdào )。(Tā chuān guò le suìdào.) - He went through the tunnel.  
- 你今天穿( nǐ jīntiān chuān )什么( shénme )？(Nǐ jīntiān chuān shénme?) - What are you wearing today?

**Usage Notes**:  
穿 (chuān) is mainly used for wearing items that "cover" the body (like clothes, shoes, socks). For accessories (hats, glasses), use 戴 (dài).

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine 穴 (xué, roof) is a house and 牙 (yá, tooth, as an object) is squeezing through-think of "pushing yourself through clothing" when you get dressed.
