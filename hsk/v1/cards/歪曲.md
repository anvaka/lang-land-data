# **歪曲 (wāi qū) - to distort; to twist (facts, truth, etc.)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **歪 (wāi)**: "Askew, crooked." Left: "歹 (dǎi)" (bad) + Right: "圭 (guī)" (jade tablets); suggests something off or not straight.  
- **曲 (qū)**: "To bend, crooked." Top: "𠃌" (bend stroke), Bottom: "曰 (yuē)" (to say); the shape hints at something bent, not straight.

**Examples**:  
- 别歪曲(wāi qū)事实(shì shí)。(Bié wāi qū shì shí.) - Don’t distort the facts.  
- 他(tā)故意(gù yì)歪曲(wāi qū)我的(wǒ de)话(huà)。(Tā gù yì wāi qū wǒ de huà.) - He deliberately twisted my words.  
- 新闻(xīn wén)不能(bù néng)歪曲(wāi qū)真相(zhēn xiàng)。(Xīn wén bù néng wāi qū zhēn xiàng.) - The news should not distort the truth.

**Usage Notes**:  
歪曲(wāi qū) is often used for abstract things like facts, truth, statements, or meanings, indicating intentional or misleading distortion.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine 歪(wāi)'s crooked lines and 曲(qū)'s bent shape-both show something not straight, just as 歪曲(wāi qū) means distorting reality.
