# **给 (gěi) - to give; for; to**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 给 (gěi): Left = 纟(sī, silk radical, "thread", indicates relation to thread or giving), Right = 合(hé, "to combine, to close", top = "人" (rén, person), center = "一" (yī, one), bottom = "口" (kǒu, mouth)). Combined: originally meant "to supply thread", now means "to give".

**Examples**:  
- 请给(gěi)我(wǒ)水(shuǐ)。 (Qǐng gěi wǒ shuǐ.) - Please give me water.  
- 这个(zhège)礼物(lǐwù)是(shì)给(gěi)你(nǐ)的(de)。 (Zhège lǐwù shì gěi nǐ de.) - This gift is for you.  
- 妈妈(māma)给(gěi)了(le)我(wǒ)一本(yì běn)书(shū)。 (Māma gěi le wǒ yì běn shū.) - Mom gave me a book.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 给(gěi) is used as a verb ("to give") and as a preposition ("for/to someone"). After the subject and before the recipient.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine using silk (纟, sī) to "give" someone a present-combine (合, hé) your effort and their happiness.  
- "给(gěi)" sounds like "gay", so "gay-give".
