# **秩序 (zhì xù) - Order; Sequence**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **秩** (zhì): Order; sequence. Radical: 禾 (hé, "grain") on the left, indicating association with counting/stalks, plus 失 (shī, "lose/miss") on right (right side). Historically related to "arranging grain stalks in order."  
- **序** (xù): Sequence; arrangement. Radical: 广 (guǎng, "shelter/building") on top, 予 (yǔ, "to give") below (bottom). Refers to orderly arrangement in a building, like seating or succession.

**Examples**:  
- 请保持秩序。(Qǐng bǎochí zhìxù.) - Please maintain order.  
- 教室里很有秩序。(Jiàoshì lǐ hěn yǒu zhìxù.) - The classroom is very orderly.  
- 混乱没有秩序。(Hùnluàn méiyǒu zhìxù.) - Chaos has no order.

**Usage Notes**:  
**秩序** (zhìxù) is used for social, organizational, or procedural order-not for "orders" or commands. Common with verbs like **保持** (bǎochí, "maintain") or **打乱** (dǎluàn, "disrupt").

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine lining up stalks of grain (禾 hé) neatly and giving (予 yǔ) everyone a proper seat under a roof (广 guǎng); that’s **秩序** (zhìxù)-everything in its place!
