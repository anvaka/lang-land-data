# **缘故 (yuán​gù) - Reason; cause**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **缘 (yuán)**: Left = 纟(sī, "silk" radical); right = 彖(tuàn, here short for "cause" or "relation"). Top and left is silk, signifying "twisting/connection," right is the main phonetic.  
- **故 (gù)**: Left = 攵(pū, "strike" radical) on the bottom left; right and top = 古(gǔ, "old", "past"). Together, suggests actions from the past-thus "cause" or "reason."

**Examples**:  
- 他(Tā)因为(yīn​wèi)某些(mǒu​xiē)缘故(yuán​gù)离开了(lí​kāi​le)。 (Tā yīn​wèi mǒu​xiē yuán​gù lí​kāi​le.) - He left for some reason.  
- 你(nǐ)知道(zhī​dào)缘故(yuán​gù)吗(ma)？ (Nǐ zhī​dào yuán​gù ma?) - Do you know the reason?  
- 真(zhēn)奇怪(qí​guài)，没(méi)有(yǒu)缘故(yuán​gù)。 (Zhēn qí​guài, méi​yǒu yuán​gù.) - It's strange, there is no reason.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 缘故(yuán​gù) is mainly used in written/formal Chinese for "reason" or "cause"; compare with 原因(yuán​yīn, "reason," more common in modern speech).

**Memory Aids**:  
- 缘(yuán) = "silk" + "connection" = reasons connect things like silk threads.  
- 故(gù) = "old" + "action" = actions from the past become reasons now.
