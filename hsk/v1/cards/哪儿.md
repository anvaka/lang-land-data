# **哪儿 (nǎr) - Where**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 哪 (nǎ): Left: 口 (kǒu, "mouth") radical; right: 那 (nà, "that") without the right-side 阝(fù), implying question/choice.  
- 儿 (ér): Bottom: 儿 (ér, "child" or "son"); often used as a rhotic suffix in northern accents; here it forms the "r" sound.

**Examples**:  
- 你去哪儿？(nǐ qù nǎr?) - Where are you going?  
- 厕所在哪儿？(cè suǒ zài nǎr?) - Where is the bathroom?  
- 我的书在哪儿？(wǒ de shū zài nǎr?) - Where is my book?

**Usage Notes**:  
哪儿 (nǎr) means "where;" it's mainly used in northern China, especially Beijing. In southern China, people often say 哪里 (nǎlǐ) for the same meaning.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine asking someone with an open mouth (口 kǒu) "that" (那 nà) question: "Where?" The 儿 (ér) ending is like saying "r" at the end-just like a Beijinger!
