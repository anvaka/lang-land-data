# **剩 (shèng) - to remain; to be left over**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 剩 (shèng): Left side is "刂" (dāo, knife) on the right, indicating cutting or division. Top is "宀" (mián, roof), under which is "生" (shēng, life/birth) at the bottom, signifying leftover or remaining after division or cutting.

**Examples**:  
- 还有剩饭吗？(hái yǒu shèng fàn ma?) - Is there any leftover rice?  
- 我们吃剩了很多菜。(wǒ men chī shèng le hěn duō cài.) - We left a lot of dishes unfinished.  
- 剩下的时间不多了。(shèng xià de shí jiān bù duō le.) - There isn't much time left.

**Usage Notes**:  
剩 (shèng) is used as a verb (to remain) or as part of phrases like 剩下 (shèng xià, left over). Paired with nouns (like 饭 fàn, food), it describes leftovers.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine after using a 刀 (dāo, knife) to cut food under a 宀 (mián, roof, a shelter/home), you have 生 (shēng, life/remaining) pieces-these are the 剩 (shèng, leftovers)!
