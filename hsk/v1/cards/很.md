# **很 (hěn) - Very**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 很 (hěn): Left side is 彳 (chì, "step" radical, left), suggesting movement or walking. Right side is 艮 (gěn, "stopping" or "stubborn"), right.

**Examples**:  
- 我很高兴。(Wǒ hěn gāoxìng.) - I am very happy.  
- 她很漂亮。(Tā hěn piàoliang.) - She is very beautiful.  
- 今天很热。(Jīntiān hěn rè.) - It is very hot today.

**Usage Notes**:  
很 (hěn) is commonly used as an intensifier meaning "very," but often functions as a neutral link between subject and adjective-especially with adjectives (e.g., 很高 (hěn gāo)). Unlike English, 很 (hěn) can be required even when "very" is not emphasized.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine you're "walking" (彳, chì, left) stubbornly (艮, gěn, right) towards something-because you're VERY determined! This helps you remember 很 (hěn) means "very."
