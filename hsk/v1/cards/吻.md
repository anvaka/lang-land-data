# **吻 (wěn) - kiss**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 吻 (wěn):
  - Radical: 口 (kǒu, "mouth") on the left
  - Right: 勿 (wù), meaning "do not," here serving a phonetic role
  - Overall: Implies an action done with the mouth (kissing)

**Examples**:  
- 他吻了她。(Tā wěn le tā.) - He kissed her.  
- 母亲吻了孩子的额头。(Mǔqīn wěn le háizi de étóu.) - The mother kissed the child's forehead.  
- 她轻轻地吻了我一下。(Tā qīngqīng de wěn le wǒ yīxià.) - She gently kissed me.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 吻 (wěn) is used as both a verb (“to kiss”) and a noun (“a kiss”).  
- Formal or literary compared to 亲 (qīn) in casual settings.

**Memory Aids**:  
- The 口 (kǒu, "mouth") radical signals actions with the mouth. Imagine you're told "勿 (wù, 'don't')" but you still sneak a kiss!
