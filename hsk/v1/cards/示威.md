# **示威 (shì wēi) - Demonstrate; Protest**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **示 (shì)**: Means “to show, to display.” The radical 礻(symbol of god/altar) is on the left (left side), indicating relation to ritual or display.  
- **威 (wēi)**: Means “power, might.” Top (top) is 戌 (xū, ancient weapon), bottom (bottom) is 女 (nǚ, woman), suggesting the power or authority.

**Examples**:  
- 工人们举行示威。(Gōngrén men jǔxíng shìwēi.) - The workers held a demonstration.  
- 学生们在校门口示威。(Xuéshēng men zài xiàomén kǒu shìwēi.) - The students protested at the school gate.  
- 政府对示威作出回应。(Zhèngfǔ duì shìwēi zuòchū huíyìng.) - The government responded to the protest.

**Usage Notes**:  
"示威 (shìwēi)" is commonly used as both a noun (“demonstration”) and a verb (“to protest, to demonstrate”); often paired with verbs like 举行 (jǔxíng, to hold) or 参加 (cānjiā, to participate).

**Memory Aids**:  
想象示 (shì, show) 和威 (wēi, power) 是“展示力量”-人们集体出来“示 (shì)”自己“威 (wēi)”风!  
Imagine "to show (示, shì)" and "power (威, wēi)" together: to “show force” as in a public demonstration.
