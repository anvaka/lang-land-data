# **落成 (luòchéng) - completion (of a building/project)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 落 (luò): "to fall" or "to land". Top: 艹 (cǎo) "grass" radical; center-right: 洛 (luò) "river name", used phonetically. Suggests "coming to a resting place."  
- 成 (chéng): "to become" or "accomplish." Left: 戈 (gē) "spear/weapon"; Right: 丁 (dīng) "nail/man." Implies something is "completed" or "formed."

**Examples**:  
- 新图书馆落成了。(Xīn túshūguǎn luòchéng le.) - The new library has been completed.  
- 大桥即将落成。(Dàqiáo jíjiāng luòchéng.) - The bridge will soon be completed.  
- 落成典礼定于下周举行。(Luòchéng diǎnlǐ dìngyú xiàzhōu jǔxíng.) - The completion ceremony is scheduled for next week.

**Usage Notes**:  
落成 (luòchéng) is usually used for expressing the completion of buildings, monuments, or major projects, not for general tasks.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think "落 (luò)" = "to fall/settle," and "成 (chéng)" = "to finish." When a building "lands" at its final form, it's completed!
