# **得不偿失 (dé bù cháng shī) - The loss outweighs the gain**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **得** (dé): to get, gain. Left: 彳 (chì, "step" radical), right: 旦 (dàn, "daybreak" component).  
- **不** (bù): not, no. A horizontal stroke above a box-like shape.  
- **偿** (cháng): to compensate. Left: 亻 (rén, "person" radical), right: 尝 (cháng, "taste", phonetic).  
- **失** (shī): to lose. Top: 丿(piě), 下 (xià, "down") strokes, bottom: 夫 (fū, "man" component, here simplified).

**Examples**:  
- 买便宜货可能得不偿失。(Mǎi pián yí huò kě néng dé bù cháng shī.) - Buying cheap goods may be more trouble than it's worth.  
- 为了一点小利而失去朋友，得不偿失。(Wèi le yī diǎn xiǎo lì ér shī qù péng yǒu, dé bù cháng shī.) - Losing a friend for small benefits is not worth it.  
- 他加班太多，健康得不偿失。(Tā jiā bān tài duō, jiàn kāng dé bù cháng shī.) - He works overtime so much that his health suffers more than the gains.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **得不偿失** (dé bù cháng shī) is often used to warn against actions where the negatives outweigh the positives.  
- Used as a predicate or comment; not before a noun.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine **得** (dé, get) is blocked by **不** (bù, not), and compensation (**偿**, cháng) cannot catch up with the loss (**失**, shī), so "gain cannot make up for the loss."
