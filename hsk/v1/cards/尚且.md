# **尚且 (shàngqiě) - "even; still; yet" (often stressing something that holds even more for another case)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **尚 (shàng)**: "still; yet"; at the top is "小 (xiǎo)" (small) over "冋 (jiōng)" (a kind of vessel/container), together originally implying "still above."  
- **且 (qiě)**: "furthermore; and"; the top has "一 (yī)" (one), bottom is "目 (mù)" (eye) - originally a pictograph of an eye, extended to mean "also/and."

**Examples**:  
- 连 (lián) 老师 (lǎoshī) 尚且 (shàngqiě) 不 (bù) 懂 (dǒng)，你 (nǐ) 怎么 (zěnme) 会 (huì) 懂 (dǒng)？(Even the teacher doesn’t understand; how could you?)  
- 这些 (zhèxiē) 问题 (wèntí) 尚且 (shàngqiě) 没有 (méiyǒu) 解决 (jiějué)。(These problems are still unsolved.)  
- 他 (tā) 尚且 (shàngqiě) 努力 (nǔlì)，我们 (wǒmen) 更 (gèng) 应该 (yīnggāi) 努力 (nǔlì)。(Even he works hard; we should work even harder.)

**Usage Notes**:  
尚且 (shàngqiě) often appears with "何况 (hékuàng)" or "更 (gèng)" to build expressions like “尚且如此，何况...” (if even ... then all the more ...). Used to emphasize contrast or progression from a lesser to a greater case.

**Memory Aids**:  
Remember 尚且 (shàngqiě) as: "Still (尚, shàng) more (且, qiě) to come." If X 尚且 (shàngqiě), then Y even more so!
