# **到处 (dàochù) - everywhere**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **到** (dào): "to arrive," "to reach." Left: 辶 (chuò) "movement/walking" on the left. Right: 至 (zhì) "to."  
- **处** (chù): "place," "location." Left: 夂 (zhǐ) at the left/top, meaning "go." Right: 处 (chù) has a part resembling a crossed "cross" and a mouth (口 kǒu) at the bottom.

**Examples**:  
- 他( tā )到处( dàochù )找( zhǎo )你( nǐ )。 (Tā dàochù zhǎo nǐ.) - He is looking for you everywhere.  
- 到处( dàochù )都是( dōushì )人( rén )。 (Dàochù dōushì rén.) - There are people everywhere.  
- 你的( nǐ de )书( shū )到处( dàochù )乱( luàn )放( fàng )。 (Nǐ de shū dàochù luàn fàng.) - Your books are scattered everywhere.

**Usage Notes**:  
到处(dàochù) usually comes before a verb and must refer to "everywhere" in a broad, general sense (not specific places). Often used for broad action spread all over a place.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine 到(dào) "arriving" + 处(chù) "places" = "arriving at all places (everywhere)." Think: you go 到处(dàochù) when you’re everywhere at once!
