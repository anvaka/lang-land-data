# **付款 (fùkuǎn) - to make a payment**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **付 (fù)**: Left side is 亻 (rén, "person" radical) + right side is 寸 (cùn, "inch").
  *Literal: a person gives an inch = to pay or hand over.*  
- **款 (kuǎn)**: Left is 欠 (qiàn, "to owe" radical, meaning breath or lack, on bottom), right is a combination of 士 (shì, "scholar") and 㐬 ("to knock/tap").
  *Often means "money," "fund," or "sum."*

**Examples**:  
- 请马上付款。(Qǐng mǎshàng fùkuǎn.) - Please make the payment immediately.  
- 我已经付款了。(Wǒ yǐjīng fùkuǎn le.) - I have already paid.  
- 付款后请保存收据。(Fùkuǎn hòu qǐng bǎocún shōujù.) - Please keep the receipt after payment.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 付款 (fùkuǎn) is a verb-object phrase, often used in business, online shopping, or service contexts.  
- The object of the payment (what you're paying for) often comes after 付款 (fùkuǎn).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think: A "person (亻)" gives an "inch (寸)" to pay, and when payment is made (欠 "to owe" + 士 "person"), the debt is settled.  
- 付款 (fùkuǎn): "Fu" sounds like "fee" and "kuan" like "coin."
