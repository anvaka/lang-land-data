# **打架 (dǎ jià) - To fight (physically); to have a physical altercation**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 打 (dǎ): "To hit, to strike." Left side is 扌(shǒu), the "hand" radical, indicating action with the hand. Right side 丁(dīng), often as a phonetic component.  
- 架 (jià): "Frame; rack." Top is 木(mù), "wood," indicating a structure. Bottom is 加(jiā), meaning "to add," but here mainly serves as a phonetic element.

**Examples**:  
- 他们 (tā men) 打架 (dǎ jià) 了 (le)。- They had a fight.  
- 孩子们 (hái zi men) 不要 (bù yào) 打架 (dǎ jià)。- Children, don’t fight.  
- 他 (tā) 经常 (jīng cháng) 和 (hé) 同学 (tóng xué) 打架 (dǎ jià)。- He often fights with classmates.

**Usage Notes**:  
打架 (dǎ jià) is usually used for physical fighting, not verbal arguments. For verbal arguments, use 吵架 (chǎo jià).

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine two people using their “hands” (打 dǎ) to hit, entangled in a “frame” (架 jià) like a wrestling ring-fighting physically.
