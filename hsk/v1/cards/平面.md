# **平面 (píngmiàn) - flat surface; plane**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **平 (píng)**: means “flat” or “level.” The main component is “干 (gān)” at the top (level, even), over a short horizontal stroke.  
- **面 (miàn)**: means “face,” “surface,” or “side.” “面 (miàn)” looks like a straight-on face (with lines suggesting features) or a flat surface.

**Examples**:  
- 这个平面很光滑。(Zhège píngmiàn hěn guānghuá.) - This surface is very smooth.  
- 我们学习几何平面。(Wǒmen xuéxí jǐhé píngmiàn.) - We study geometric planes.  
- 请在平面上画一条线。(Qǐng zài píngmiàn shàng huà yì tiáo xiàn.) - Please draw a line on the plane.

**Usage Notes**:  
平面 (píngmiàn) is often used in mathematics, geometry, art, and design to refer to two-dimensional surfaces or planes.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 平 (píng) as a “level” and 面 (miàn) as a “side” or “face”-together: a level surface or a flat plane.
