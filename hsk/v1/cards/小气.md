# **小气 (xiǎoqì) - Stingy / Mean**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 小 (xiǎo): "small" or "little." Top: three small strokes resemble "tiny."  
- 气 (qì): "air" or "energy." Top: dots hint at rising steam; bottom: represents vapor.

**Examples**:  
- 他很小气。(Tā hěn xiǎoqì.) - He is very stingy.  
- 不要那么小气。(Bù yào nàme xiǎoqì.) - Don't be so mean.  
- 小气的人不喜欢分享。(Xiǎoqì de rén bù xǐhuān fēnxiǎng.) - Stingy people don't like to share.

**Usage Notes**:  
小气 (xiǎoqì) describes someone unwilling to share or spend, often with money or resources. Used informally, sometimes humorously.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think "small (小 xiǎo)" + "spirit (气 qì)": a person with a "small spirit" is not generous-stingy.
