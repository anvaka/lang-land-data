# **结果 (jiéguǒ) - Result; outcome**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **结 (jié)**: "to tie, knot, conclude." The left is 纟(sī) "silk" radical (left), indicating things related to threads or binding; the right is 吉(jí), meaning "lucky" or "auspicious".  
- **果 (guǒ)**: "fruit, result." The top is 木(mù) "tree" radical (top), the bottom is 田(tián) "field" (bottom), suggesting something produced from a tree in the field.

**Examples**:  
- 结果 (jiéguǒ) 很好。(hěn hǎo.) - The result is good.  
- 他努力了，结果 (jiéguǒ) 成功了。(tā nǔlì le, jiéguǒ chénggōng le.) - He worked hard, and as a result, succeeded.  
- 我没看说明，结果 (jiéguǒ) 出错了。(wǒ méi kàn shuōmíng, jiéguǒ chūcuò le.) - I didn’t read the instructions; as a result, I made a mistake.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 结果 (jiéguǒ) can be a noun ("result") or a conjunction meaning "as a result"/"in the end".  
- Often used to state outcomes of actions or events.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Picture 结 (jié) "tying" together actions, and 果 (guǒ) as the "fruit" or "outcome" produced. So, 结果 (jiéguǒ): tying actions leads to the fruit/result.
