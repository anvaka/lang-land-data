# **曾经 (céngjīng) - once; previously; ever**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **曾 (céng)**: Top-"日 (rì)" (sun); Bottom-"八 (bā)" (eight, splitting). Originally means "greatly," now used to express "once" or "ever."  
- **经 (jīng)**: Left-"纟 (sī)" (silk); Right-"巠 (jīng)" (pass through). Carries the meaning of "to experience" or "to pass through" in this compound.

**Examples**:  
- 我( wǒ )曾经( céngjīng )去过( qùguo )中国( Zhōngguó )。 (Wǒ céngjīng qùguo Zhōngguó.) - I have been to China before.  
- 他( tā )曾经( céngjīng )是( shì )老师( lǎoshī )。 (Tā céngjīng shì lǎoshī.) - He used to be a teacher.  
- 你( nǐ )曾经( céngjīng )见过( jiànguo )她( tā )吗( ma )？ (Nǐ céngjīng jiànguo tā ma?) - Have you ever met her?

**Usage Notes**:  
曾经( céngjīng ) usually appears before the verb to express past experiences, often with 过( guo ) for "have ever." It emphasizes something happened in the past but may no longer be true.

**Memory Aids**:  
曾经( céngjīng )-Think: "I have *once* passed (经过(jīngguò)) this way before," combining "once" (曾(céng)) and "experience" (经(jīng)).
