# **告诫 (gào jiè) - to warn; to admonish**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **告 (gào)**: Top: "牛 (niú)" (cow); Bottom: "口 (kǒu)" (mouth). Meaning: to tell, to inform. Origin: suggesting speaking about cattle, relating to making announcements.  
- **诫 (jiè)**: Left: "讠(yán)" (speech radical); Right: "戒 (jiè)" (to guard against). Meaning: to admonish or warn. Origin: words about caution.

**Examples**:  
- 父亲 (fùqīn) 告诫 (gào jiè) 我不要撒谎 (wǒ bú yào sāhuǎng)。- Father warned me not to lie.  
- 老师 (lǎoshī) 常常 (chángcháng) 告诫 (gào jiè) 我们 (wǒmen) 要努力 (yào nǔlì) 学习 (xuéxí)。- The teacher often admonishes us to study hard.

**Usage Notes**:  
告诫 (gào jiè) is formal; often used in writing, moral, or serious contexts. Typically for elders/authorities warning juniors/subordinates. Less emotional than 警告 (jǐnggào, warn).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "告 (gào)"-announce + "诫 (jiè)"-advice = announced warning/advice. Imagine someone *speaking* (口, kǒu/yán, yán) *seriously* (戒, jiè/guard) to guide your behavior.
