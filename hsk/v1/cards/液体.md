# **液体 (yètǐ) - Liquid**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **液** (yè): Left: "氵" (shuǐ, water radical) on the left; right: "夜" (yè, night) on the right. Together, relates to "liquid/fluid."  
- **体** (tǐ): Left: "亻" (rén, person radical) on the left; right: "本" (běn, root) on the right. "Body" or "form."

**Examples**:  
- 水是液体。(Shuǐ shì yètǐ.) - Water is a liquid.  
- 液体在杯子里。(Yètǐ zài bēizi lǐ.) - The liquid is in the cup.  
- 请把这种液体倒进去。(Qǐng bǎ zhè zhǒng yètǐ dào jìnqù.) - Please pour this kind of liquid in.

**Usage Notes**:  
**液体** (yètǐ) is a scientific term for "liquid," the state of matter between solid (**固体** gùtǐ) and gas (**气体** qìtǐ). Often used in technical, medical, or everyday contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of **液** (yè) with the "water" radical for something fluid, and **体** (tǐ) as "body/form" - so **液体** (yètǐ) = "liquid body/form." Water (**水** shuǐ) is the most common **液体** (yètǐ).
