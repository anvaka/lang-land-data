# **复活 (fùhuó) - to resurrect, to revive**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **复 (fù)**: Means "return," "repeat," or "again." Structure: Top is "人 (rén)" (person), representing a person, over "一 (yī)" (one), above "日 (rì)" (sun). The idea is returning or repeating, like the sun returning.  
- **活 (huó)**: Means "live" or "alive." Left is "氵 (shuǐ)" (water radical), signifying life, right is "舌 (shé)" (tongue), relating to action or movement.

**Examples**:  
- 耶稣复活了。(Yēsū fùhuó le.) - Jesus resurrected.  
- 植物在春天复活。(Zhíwù zài chūntiān fùhuó.) - Plants revive in spring.  
- 这个传统正在复活。(Zhè ge chuántǒng zhèngzài fùhuó.) - This tradition is being revived.

**Usage Notes**:  
"复活 (fùhuó)" is used for literal resurrection (myth, religion), and metaphorically for things coming back to life, e.g., traditions, economies.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think "复 (fù)" = repeat + "活 (huó)" = life, so "life returns again." "Water (氵) brings life (活)" and "复 (fù)" is to do again-resurrection!
