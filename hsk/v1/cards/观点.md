# **观点 (guān diǎn) - Point of view; opinion**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 观 (guān): To observe, look at. Left: 见 (jiàn, "see") on the right; right: 又 (yòu, "again") at the bottom, suggesting repeated seeing.  
- 点 (diǎn): Point, dot. Top: 黑 (hēi, "black"); bottom: 灬 (huǒ, "fire" as dots), like a drop or small mark.

**Examples**:  
- 每个人都有不同的观点 (měi gè rén dōu yǒu bù tóng de guān diǎn) - Everyone has different points of view.  
- 我同意你的观点 (wǒ tóng yì nǐ de guān diǎn) - I agree with your opinion.  
- 请说说你的观点 (qǐng shuō shuō nǐ de guān diǎn) - Please share your point of view.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 观点 (guān diǎn) is often followed by 认为 (rèn wéi, "think/believe") or expressed with verbs like 支持 (zhī chí, "support"). Used formally and informally.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 观 (guān) (observe) + 点 (diǎn) (dot/point): "The point you see" = your point of view.  
- Imagine seeing (观 guān) one specific point (点 diǎn) - that's your own perspective!
