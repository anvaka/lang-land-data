# **互相 (hùxiāng) - each other; mutually**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **互** (hù): means "each other" or "mutual." The character features a "二" (èr, two) on top, and "丨" (gǔn, line) at the bottom, forming an ancient pictograph of exchange.  
- **相** (xiāng): means "mutual," "each other," or "appearance." The left side is the "木" (mù, wood) radical, and the right side is "目" (mù, eye), suggesting looking at one another.

**Examples**:  
- 他们互相(​tāmen hùxiāng)帮助(bāngzhù)。- They help each other.  
- 我们互相(hùxiāng)理解(lǐjiě)。- We understand each other.  
- 互相(hùxiāng)尊重(zūnzhòng)很重要(hěn zhòngyào)。- Mutual respect is important.

**Usage Notes**:  
互相(hùxiāng) usually comes before a verb to indicate two-sided or mutual actions. Not used with verbs describing one's own state (e.g., not with "喜欢(xǐhuān)" for self-liking).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think "互(hù)" = "exchange" and "相(xiāng)" = "face to face"; so, 互相(hùxiāng) is "facing and exchanging with each other."
