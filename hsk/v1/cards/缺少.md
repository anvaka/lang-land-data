# **缺少 (quē shǎo) - lack; be short of**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **缺** (quē): Means "lack" or "be short of." The left side has the radical "缶" (fǒu, a pottery jar), while the right side "夬" (guài, decisive) implies separation, suggesting something missing from a vessel.  
- **少** (shǎo): Means "few" or "less." The top stroke represents smallness, and the two dots below indicate a reduction in number.

**Examples**:  
- 我们( wǒ men) 缺少( quē shǎo) 时间( shí jiān)。 (wǒ men quē shǎo shí jiān) - We lack time.  
- 他( tā) 缺少( quē shǎo) 经验( jīng yàn)。 (tā quē shǎo jīng yàn) - He is short of experience.
