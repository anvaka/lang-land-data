# **夏 (xià) - Summer**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 夏 (xià): The main component is at the top, resembling a cover or roof, and below are strokes that look like a person walking. The bottom part resembles the radical 夂 (zhǐ - go), implying movement or change of seasons.

**Examples**:  
- 今年夏天很热。 (jīn nián xià tiān hěn rè.) - This summer is very hot.  
- 我喜欢夏天游泳。 (wǒ xǐ huān xià tiān yóu yǒng.) - I like swimming in summer.  
- 夏天是放假的季节。 (xià tiān shì fàng jià de jì jié.) - Summer is the season for holidays.

**Usage Notes**:  
夏 (xià) is often paired with 天 (tiān) as 夏天 (xià tiān) to mean "summer." It can be used alone in poetic or formal contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of the "cover" (top) shading a "person" (bottom) from the sun in hot summer (夏, xià). Or imagine "going" into the summer season with action at the bottom.
