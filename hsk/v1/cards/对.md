# **对 (duì) - Correct; to; towards; pair**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 对 (duì): Left: 又 (yòu) “right hand”; Right: 寸 (cùn) “inch.” Suggests “hands matching/measuring an inch”-origin of “pair” or “match.”

**Examples**:  
- 你说得对。(Nǐ shuō de duì.) - You are right.  
- 对不起。(Duì bù qǐ.) - Sorry.  
- 他对我笑了。(Tā duì wǒ xiào le.) - He smiled at me.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 对 (duì) as “correct/right” is often used alone or after verbs.  
- Used as a preposition: 对 (duì) + noun means “towards/to” someone/something.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think: Hands (又 yòu) measuring an exact inch (寸 cùn) = exactly correct/match.  
- Like two pieces (hands) fitting together = “correct” or “pair.”
