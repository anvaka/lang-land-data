# **生病 (shēng bìng) - to get sick; to fall ill**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 生 (shēng): Means "to be born," "life," or "grow." The top is the "grass" radical (⺾ cǎo) indicating life, and the bottom shows the horizontal line of earth.  
- 病 (bìng): Means "illness" or "disease." Left: "sickness" radical (疒 nè) on top-left; right: 并 (bìng) meaning "together," serving as the phonetic component.

- 你 (nǐ) 怎么 (zěnme) 生病 (shēng bìng) 了 (le)？ (Nǐ zěnme shēngbìng le?) - How did you get sick?

**Usage Notes**:  
- 生病 (shēng bìng) acts as a verb.  
- Often followed by 了 (le) for completed action.  
- Can be combined with adjectives: 重 (zhòng) 生病 (shēng bìng) - seriously ill.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 生 (shēng): Life → you're alive.  
- 病 (bìng): The "sickness" radical plus "together" (illness brings things together in your body).  
- 生病 (shēng bìng): When life (生 shēng) meets illness (病 bìng), you get sick!
