# **动静 (dòngjìng) - Movement; activity; news**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 动 (dòng): means "move; movement." Left: "云" (yún, cloud) on top of "力" (lì, strength, at the bottom)-suggests using strength like moving clouds.  
- 静 (jìng): means "quiet; still." Left: "青" (qīng, blue/green) on top, right: "争" (zhēng, to contend) inside-traditionally implies calm after struggle.

**Examples**:  
- 你听到什么动静 (nǐ tīngdào shénme dòngjìng) - Did you hear any movement?  
- 孩子房间一点动静也没有 (háizi fángjiān yìdiǎn dòngjìng yě méiyǒu) - There is no sound from the child's room.  
- 有什么动静马上告诉我 (yǒu shénme dòngjìng mǎshàng gàosu wǒ) - Tell me immediately if there is any news/activity.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 动静 (dòngjìng) can mean "movement/sound," "activity," or "news/sign of action," often in the context of waiting for developments; commonly used in both literal and figurative senses.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 动 (dòng, move) + 静 (jìng, still) = any change from stillness means movement or news.  
- Imagine being alert for any 动静 (dòngjìng) at night-waiting for a disturbance in the peace.
