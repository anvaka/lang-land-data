# **勿 (wù) - do not; must not**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 勿 (wù): Consists of 亅 (jué, a hooked stroke) on the top and 力 (lì, "strength") on the bottom. The traditional form depicts a person with arms, meaning "to stop" or "not."

**Examples**:  
- 勿 (wù) 忘 (wàng) 带 (dài) 伞 (sǎn)。 (wù wàng dài sǎn.) - Do not forget your umbrella.  
- 勿 (wù) 动 (dòng)。 (wù dòng.) - Do not move.  
- 请 (qǐng) 勿 (wù) 吸烟 (xī yān)。 (qǐng wù xī yān.) - Please do not smoke.

**Usage Notes**:  
勿 (wù) is formal and typically appears in signs, instructions, and written warnings. It is less common in spoken conversation than 别 (bié) or 不要 (bù yào).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 勿 (wù) as a "NO" sign: the top line and hook "stop" you, and you need "strength" (力 lì) to resist doing something.
