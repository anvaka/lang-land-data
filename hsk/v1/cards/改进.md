# **改进 (gǎi jìn) - Improve; Improvement**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **改 (gǎi)**: "to change, to alter." Left: 攵 (pū, right hand, right side), meaning "to strike or change." Right: 己 (jǐ, self, left side).  
- **进 (jìn)**: "to advance, to move forward." Left: 辶 (chuò, walk, bottom), indicating movement. Right: 井 (jǐng, well, top), suggesting direction.

**Examples**:  
- 我们需要改进工作方法。(Wǒmen xūyào gǎi jìn gōngzuò fāngfǎ.) - We need to improve our working methods.  
- 他正在改进产品设计。(Tā zhèngzài gǎi jìn chǎnpǐn shèjì.) - He is improving the product design.  
- 公司不断改进服务质量。(Gōngsī bùduàn gǎi jìn fúwù zhìliàng.) - The company constantly improves service quality.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 改进 (gǎi jìn) is usually used for methods, systems, designs, or processes, not for personal improvement (use 提高 tígāo or 改善 gǎishàn for that).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine 改 (gǎi, to change) as editing something, and 进 (jìn, to advance) as moving forward-the word means change for the better, or "advance through change."
