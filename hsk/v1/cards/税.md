# **税 (shuì) - Tax**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 税 (shuì): The left side is 禾 (hé) meaning “grain” (radical for plants, on the left), and the right side is 兑 (duì) meaning “exchange” (right). Combining them hints at collecting a share (tax) from grain.

**Examples**:  
- 交税 (jiāo shuì) - pay taxes  
- 税务局 (shuì wù jú) - tax bureau  
- 这个商品要收税。 (zhè ge shāng pǐn yào shōu shuì.) - This product is taxed.

**Usage Notes**:  
税 (shuì) is a noun and often appears in formal or governmental contexts. Common collocations: 税收 (shuì shōu - taxation), 税率 (shuì lǜ - tax rate).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: The "grain" 禾 (hé) on the left represents what people grow, and the "exchange" 兑 (duì) on the right shows what the government takes-a share of the harvest as tax.
