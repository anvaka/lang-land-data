# **滑 (huá) - slippery; to slip; to slide**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **滑** (huá): The left side is the "water" radical **氵** (shuǐ), indicating relation to liquid or smoothness. The right side **骨** (gǔ) means "bone," suggesting smooth, slippery surfaces.

**Examples**:  
- 地上很滑。(Dì shàng hěn huá.) - The floor is slippery.  
- 小孩喜欢滑滑梯。(Xiǎohái xǐhuan huá huátī.) - Kids like to slide on the slide.  
- 他滑倒了。(Tā huá dǎo le.) - He slipped and fell.

**Usage Notes**:  
**滑** (huá) is both an adjective (slippery) and verb (to slip/slide). Often used with surfaces, actions, or even metaphoric contexts (e.g., **滑头** (huá tóu), meaning "slippery person": sly or cunning).

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine "water" (**氵** (shuǐ), on the left) makes "bones" (**骨** (gǔ), on the right) slip-when bones are wet, they become **滑** (huá) and can slip easily!
