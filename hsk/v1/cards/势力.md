# **势力 (shì lì) - Influence; Power; Force**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 势 (shì): Means "power," "force," or "tendency." Left side is 扌 (shǒu, "hand" radical), showing action, right side is 𢦏 (shì), originally meaning "position" or "circumstance."  
- 力 (lì): Means "strength," "force." It shows a pictograph of a plow, representing physical power.

**Examples**:  
- 这个国家的势力(shì lì)很大。(Zhè ge guójiā de shì lì hěn dà.) - This country has great power.  
- 他在公司没有什么势力(shì lì)。(Tā zài gōngsī méiyǒu shénme shì lì.) - He doesn't have much influence in the company.  
- 那个组织的势力(shì lì)正在扩大。(Nàgè zǔzhī de shì lì zhèngzài kuòdà.) - That organization's influence is expanding.

**Usage Notes**:  
势力(shì lì) can refer to physical power, social influence, or a group's reach. Often used in social, political, or business contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 势(shì) as "showing power" with a hand (扌) acting, and 力(lì) as the basic unit for "force." Together they mean "the reach or clout someone's strength achieves."
