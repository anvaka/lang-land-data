# **地道 (dì dào) - Authentic; tunnel**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **地** (dì): "Earth; ground". Radical 土 (tǔ, earth) on the left; right side 也 (yě, also). Often relates to land or location.  
- **道** (dào): "Way; path; method". Radical 辶 (chuò, movement) at the bottom; 首 (shǒu, head) on the top. Often suggests a route or correctness.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **地道** (dìdào) is used to mean “genuine” or “authentic,” especially for food, language, or customs.  
- It can also mean "tunnel" in military or construction contexts, but as an adjective, it describes authenticity.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of “地” (dì, ground) for something native to the land, and “道” (dào, way) as the right path-“地道” (dìdào) is the genuine way of the land!
