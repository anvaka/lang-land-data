# **支流 (zhī liú) - Tributary; minor branch (of river, topic, etc.)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **支** (zhī): "branch" or "support." Left: "十" (shí, ten) and "又" (yòu, again/hand).  
- **流** (liú): "flow." Left: "氵" (shuǐ, water radical) and right: "㐬" (liú, stream/currents).

**Examples**:  
- 这条河有很多支流。(zhè tiáo hé yǒu hěn duō zhī liú.) - This river has many tributaries.  
- 那个观点只是支流。(nà gè guān diǎn zhǐ shì zhī liú.) - That idea is just a minor branch.  
- 支流汇入了大河。(zhī liú huì rù le dà hé.) - The tributary flows into the main river.

**Usage Notes**:  
**支流** (zhī liú) is both geographic (tributary) and metaphorical (secondary/less important branch of a topic). Typically a noun.

**Memory Aids**:  
Picture "支" (zhī, support/branch) as a branch, and "流" (liú, flow) as water-so **支流** (zhī liú) is a "branch that flows" (branch of a river).
