# **差 (chā/chà/chāi) - Difference; bad; errand**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 差 (chā/chà/chāi): Left side is 羊 (yáng, “sheep”) atop; right side is 工 (gōng, “work”) at the bottom. The “sheep” (羊) radical (top) often relates to goodness, but when combined with “work” (工, bottom), the meaning shifts to “difference/discrepancy" or “errand.”

**Examples**:  
- 成绩很差 (chéngjì hěn chà) - The grade is very bad.  
- 只差一点 (zhǐ chà yì diǎn) - Just a little bit short.  
- 出差 (chū chāi) - Go on a business trip.

**Usage Notes**:  
差 (chā/chà) as an adjective means “bad” or “poor quality.” As a verb, 差 (chā) means “to differ by.” As a noun, 出差 (chū chāi) means “to go on a work errand/trip.” Tone changes alter meaning and part of speech.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "Sheep (羊 yáng) at work (工 gōng) can do a good job, but if not, the result is 差 (chà) - bad or with a difference."
