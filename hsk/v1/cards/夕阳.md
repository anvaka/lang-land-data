# **夕阳 (xī yáng) - Sunset**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 夕 (xī): means "evening" or "dusk." The top stroke represents a moon or declining sun; bottom is a person or object below the horizon, symbolizing the end of the day.  
- 阳 (yáng): means "sun" or "positive (yang, as in yin-yang)." The left is the 阝(yì) "hill" radical; right is 昜(yáng), which means "sun raising over the horizon."

**Examples**:  
- 夕阳(xī yáng)很美。(hěn měi.) - The sunset is beautiful.  
- 老人在夕阳(xī yáng)下散步。(lǎo rén zài xī yáng xià sàn bù.) - The old man is taking a walk under the sunset.  
- 我喜欢拍夕阳(xī yáng)的照片。(wǒ xǐ huān pāi xī yáng de zhào piàn.) - I like to take pictures of the sunset.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 夕阳(xī yáng) often appears in poetic contexts, expressing beauty or an ending. Can be used literally (sunset) or metaphorically (twilight years, later stages of life).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine 夕(xī) as the setting sun and 阳(yáng) as the sun’s brightness-together, “the sun at dusk.”
