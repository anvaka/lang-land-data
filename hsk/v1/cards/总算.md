# **总算 (zǒngsuàn) - finally; at last; after all**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **总** (zǒng): "altogether, overall." Left: **糸** (mì, silk, thread); right/top: **公** (gōng, public) - suggests "combining threads" or "general."  
- **算** (suàn): "to calculate, count." Top: **⺮** (zhú, bamboo) - abacus rods; bottom: **目** (mù, eye) + **廾** (gǒng, two hands) - "to calculate visually with hands."

**Examples**:  
- 我们**总算**(zǒngsuàn)到家了。(Wǒmen zǒngsuàn dào jiā le.) - We finally arrived home.  
- 他**总算**(zǒngsuàn)明白了。(Tā zǒngsuàn míngbai le.) - He finally understood.  
- 雨**总算**(zǒngsuàn)停了。(Yǔ zǒngsuàn tíng le.) - The rain finally stopped.

**Usage Notes**:  
**总算**(zǒngsuàn) often expresses relief after waiting or difficulty. Usually at the start or before the verb. Synonymous with **终于**(zhōngyú) but often adds a sense of effort or delay.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think "**总**(zǒng)" as "always" and "**算**(suàn)" as "calculate"-after all calculations, you "finally" get a result!
