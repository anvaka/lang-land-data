# **侄子 (zhí zi) - Nephew (brother's son)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 侄 (zhí): "Nephew." Left: 亻 (rén páng, "person" radical, left side); right: 至 (zhì), originally means "to arrive."  
- 子 (zi): "Child" or "son." Single character pictograph of a child.

**Examples**:  
- 我有一个可爱的侄子。(Wǒ yǒu yī gè kě'ài de zhí zi.) - I have a cute nephew.  
- 侄子今年五岁了。(Zhí zi jīn nián wǔ suì le.) - My nephew is five this year.  
- 他带侄子去公园玩。(Tā dài zhí zi qù gōngyuán wán.) - He took his nephew to the park.

**Usage Notes**:  
侄子 (zhí zi) refers only to a brother’s son. For a sister’s son, use 外甥 (wài shēng).

**Memory Aids**:  
侄 (zhí) uses the "person" radical (亻) since a nephew is a person related to you; 子 (zi) means "child"-so together, "person-child" related to you by your brother!
