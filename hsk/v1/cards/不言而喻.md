# **不言而喻 (bù yán ér yù) - Self-evident; it goes without saying**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **不(bù)**: Not; negative. Simple 一(yī) on top, 口(kǒu, mouth) below.  
- **言(yán)**: Speak; speech. Radical 言(yán) itself, looks like a mouth (口kǒu) atop lines for sound.  
- **而(ér)**: And; but. Top 𠂉(bā), bottom 冊(cè, book/pages). Used here as a connector ("and thus").  
- **喻(yù)**: Explain; make understood. Left: 口(kǒu, mouth); right: 俞(yú, agree/consent).

**Examples**:  
- 这个道理不言而喻。(zhè ge dào lǐ bù yán ér yù.) - This principle is self-evident.  
- 他的错误不言而喻。(tā de cuò wù bù yán ér yù.) - His mistake is obvious.  
- 成功的原因不言而喻。(chéng gōng de yuán yīn bù yán ér yù.) - The reason for success is clear without explanation.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **不言而喻(bù yán ér yù)** is often used for facts or truths that are obvious without needing verbal explanation.  
- Used as a predicate (after subject), not before nouns.

**Memory Aids**:  
"If you 'do not (不bù) speak (言yán),' yet it 'is understood (喻yù) anyway,' the meaning is self-evident."  
Imagine two people: without a word, they both already know!
