# **葡萄 (pú tao) - grape**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **葡 (pú)**
  - Left: 艹 (cǎo) - "grass" radical, top of character (indicates plant association)
  - Right: 匍 (pú) - phonetic, means "to crawl" (plants that spread/crawl)  
- **萄 (táo)**
  - Left: 艹 (cǎo) - "grass" radical, top
  - Right: 匋 (táo) - phonetic, refers to pottery, just for sound

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢吃葡萄。(Wǒ xǐhuān chī pú tao.) - I like to eat grapes.  
- 葡萄酒很好喝。(Pú tao jiǔ hěn hǎo hē.) - Grape wine is delicious.  
- 这些葡萄很甜。(Zhèxiē pú tao hěn tián.) - These grapes are very sweet.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 葡萄 (pú tao) = grape(s), often used for both singular and plural.  
- Common in food contexts; 葡萄酒 (pú tao jiǔ) = wine.

**Memory Aids**:  
“Grass” tops show it’s a plant; sounds like “putao”-imagine “put a grape in your mouth.” Both characters start with 艹 (cǎo), hinting they’re from the same plant family!
