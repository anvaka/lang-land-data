# **失事 (shīshì) - Accident; To crash**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **失 (shī)**: Means "to lose" or "miss". Radical: 大 (dà, "big") on the top, with a twist-there's a slight stroke inside.  
- **事 (shì)**: Means "matter" or "affair". Radical: 亅 (jué, "hook") on the right; the left shows a wide horizontal 支 (zhī) shape with lines inside.

**Examples**:  
- 飞机失事了。(Fēijī shīshì le.) - The plane crashed.  
- 他们昨晚失事了。(Tāmen zuówǎn shīshì le.) - They had an accident last night.  
- 没有人在失事中幸存。(Méiyǒu rén zài shīshì zhōng xìngcún.) - No one survived the accident.

**Usage Notes**:  
失事 (shīshì) is usually used for serious accidents, especially for vehicles (planes, boats, cars). It's a formal term, not suitable for minor mishaps.

**Memory Aids**:  
失 (shī) = "to lose," 事 (shì) = "affair" → "Lost affair" = "accident". Imagine "losing control of matters" causing an accident.
