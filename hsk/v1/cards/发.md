# **发 (fā) - to send; to emit; to develop**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 发 (fā): Left: “又”(yòu)-“again/hand” radical, Right/top: “⺁”(yì)-variant, related to “hair” or “departure.” The character can suggest the idea of moving forward or sending out.

**Examples**:  
- 请发邮件给我。(Qǐng fā yóujiàn gěi wǒ.) - Please send me an email.  
- 他发了一条短信。(Tā fā le yì tiáo duǎnxìn.) - He sent a text message.  
- 我感到很发愁。(Wǒ gǎndào hěn fāchóu.) - I feel very worried.

**Usage Notes**:  
发 (fā) is a versatile verb: “to send” (messages, goods), “to emit” (light, sound), “to grow/develop.” Different from 发 (fà) in 头发 (tóufa) meaning "hair."

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of a hand (又 yòu) on the left "sending out" something - 发 (fā) means “to send” or “issue.”
