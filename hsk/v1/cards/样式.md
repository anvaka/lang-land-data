# **样式 (yàngshì) - style; pattern; type**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **样 (yàng)**:
  - Left: "⽺ (yáng)" sheep radical, often related to appearance or form.
  - Right: "⺀ (mù)" tree, suggesting shape/structure.  
- **式 (shì)**:
  - Left: "⼯ (gōng)" work/skill radical.
  - Right: "弋 (yì)" shoot; here indicates method or form.

**Examples**:  
- 这种样式很流行。(Zhè zhǒng yàngshì hěn liúxíng.) - This style is very popular.  
- 你喜欢哪种样式？(Nǐ xǐhuān nǎ zhǒng yàngshì?) - Which type do you like?  
- 他们的衣服样式各异。(Tāmen de yīfu yàngshì gè yì.) - Their clothing styles are all different.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **样式 (yàngshì)** is used for design, format, or visual type of objects like text, clothing, furniture.  
- Can be formal (technical) or everyday speech.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think "样 (yàng)" = looks (like a sheep’s unique wool), "式 (shì)" = way/shape (like a methodical worker). Together: the way something looks-its style!
