# **次 (cì) - time; occurrence**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 次 (cì):
  - Radical: 冫(bīng) "ice" on the left
  - Right: 欠(qiàn) “yawn; lack”
  - Originally related to “sequence,” connected with “cold” and “lack,” now means “time; occurrence.”

**Examples**:  
- 你去过几次？(Nǐ qù guò jǐ cì?) - How many times have you been?  
- 这是我第一次来。(Zhè shì wǒ dì yī cì lái.) - This is my first time here.  
- 下次见！(Xià cì jiàn!) - See you next time!

**Usage Notes**:  
- 次 (cì) counts occurrences: 一次 (yī cì: one time), 三次 (sān cì: three times).  
- Often used after verbs, e.g., 看一次 (kàn yī cì: look once).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think: After something happens once, it’s the “next” in a “sequence.”  
- 冫(bīng) (ice) hints at an event “frozen in time.”
