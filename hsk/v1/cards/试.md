# **试 (shì) - to try; to test**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **试** (shì): Left: “讠” (yán) - speech radical, indicates relation to words or speaking; Right: “式” (shì). “式” originally meant “formula” or “style,” here represents pronunciation and meaning related to standards or methods.

**Examples**:  
- 请试一下。(Qǐng shì yíxià.) - Please try it.  
- 我想试试这件衣服。(Wǒ xiǎng shìshi zhè jiàn yīfu.) - I want to try on this piece of clothing.  
- 你试过了吗？(Nǐ shì guò le ma?) - Have you tried it?

**Usage Notes**:  
- **试** (shì) is commonly used with **一下** (yíxià, "a bit") or reduplicated (**试试** (shìshi)), both soften the tone and make the request polite.  
- Can mean "to test" (e.g., **考试** (kǎoshì), "exam").

**Memory Aids**:  
- The **讠** (yán, speech) suggests some form of interaction or communication; the **式** (shì, style/method) hints at trying a way or method-so **试** (shì) is "to try (out)" or "test (out)" by communication or action.
