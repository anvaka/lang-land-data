# **乙 (yǐ) - Second; B**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **乙** (yǐ): One of the simplest Chinese characters, resembling a curved stroke. It is the 2nd of the "Ten Heavenly Stems" (天干, tiāngān). The stroke curves from top left to bottom right, then hooks left at the bottom.

**Examples**:  
- 甲乙丙丁 (jiǎ yǐ bǐng dīng) - A, B, C, D  
- 乙方 (yǐ fāng) - Party B (in contracts)  
- 他得了乙等成绩 (tā dé le yǐ děng chéngjì) - He got a B grade

**Usage Notes**:  
- Commonly used as a label (like 'B') in lists, contracts, or ranking.  
- Rarely used as a standalone word in daily conversation.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Looks like a bent figure "2"-which is appropriate, as 乙 (yǐ) means "second."  
- Imagine the hook "catching" the second spot in a lineup.
