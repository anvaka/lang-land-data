- 这个号码已经被使用了。(zhège hàomǎ yǐjīng bèi shǐyòng le.) - This number has already been used.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **号码** (hàomǎ) is used for assigned numbers, such as phone, ticket, or ID numbers-not for counting items.  
- Commonly appears after a noun: e.g., 电话号码 (diànhuà hàomǎ, phone number).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine you "announce" (**号** (hào), mouth radical) each "code" (**码** (mǎ), horse runs with a numbered tag) aloud.  
- **号** (hào) looks like a "mouth" calling out a number; **码** (mǎ) contains "马" (mǎ), imagine a horse in a race with a number on it.
