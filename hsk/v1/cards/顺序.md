# **顺序 (shùn xù) - Order; Sequence**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **顺 (shùn)**: Top is 川 (chuān; river), representing flow. Left side is 页 (yè; page/head), indicating direction. Means "along", "to follow", or "smooth".  
- **序 (xù)**: Left is 广 (guǎng; shelter) on top-left. Right is 予 (yǔ; to give) inside. Means "order", "sequence", or "arrangement".

**Examples**:  
- 请 (qǐng) 按 (àn) 顺序 (shùn xù) 排队 (pái duì)。 (Please line up in order.)  
- 孩子们 (hái zi men) 按 (àn) 顺序 (shùn xù) 说话 (shuō huà)。 (The children speak in turn.)  
- 你 (nǐ) 能 (néng) 按 (àn) 顺序 (shùn xù) 写出 (xiě chū) 这些词 (zhè xiē cí) 吗 (ma)？ (Can you write these words in order?)

**Usage Notes**:  
- 顺序 (shùn xù) is often used to talk about the correct, logical, or required order of things.  
- Common with verbs like 按 (àn; according to), 保持 (bǎo chí; to maintain).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine 顺 (shùn; follow) as water (川 (chuān)) flowing smoothly over pages (页 (yè)), moving in order (序 (xù)).  
- "顺 (shùn)" = go with the flow, "序 (xù)" = the arrangement. Together, things flow in sequence!
