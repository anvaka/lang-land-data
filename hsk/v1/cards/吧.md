# **吧 (ba) - modal particle; suggestion, softening tone**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 吧 (ba): Left-口 (kǒu, "mouth"), indicating speech; Right-巴 (bā), phonetic component.

**Examples**:  
- 我们走吧。(Wǒmen zǒu ba.) - Let's go.  
- 休息一下吧。(Xiūxi yīxià ba.) - Take a rest.  
- 你是老师吧？(Nǐ shì lǎoshī ba?) - You are a teacher, right?

**Usage Notes**:  
吧 (ba) softens the tone of a suggestion, request, or assumption. Common at the end of sentences for politeness or uncertainty.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 吧 (ba) as a "verbal cushion"-it softens what you're saying, like a gentle nudge. 口 (kǒu, mouth) on the left hints it’s spoken.
