# **符合 (fú hé) - to conform to; to meet (the standard)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **符** (fú): Left: **竹** (zhú) "bamboo" radical (top), Right: **付** (fù) "to hand something over" (bottom); originally referred to tallies or documents made of bamboo, later extended to "to match" or "tally."  
- **合** (hé): Top: **亼** (jí) "to gather", Bottom: **口** (kǒu) "mouth"; overall meaning "to combine, join together."

**Examples**:  
- 这个计划符合(zhè gè jì huà fú hé)公司的要求。(gōng sī de yāo qiú) - This plan meets the company's requirements.  
- 你的行为不符合(nǐ de xíng wéi bù fú hé)规定。(guī dìng) - Your actions do not conform to the rules.  
- 产品需要符合(chǎn pǐn xū yào fú hé)安全标准。(ān quán biāo zhǔn) - The product needs to meet safety standards.

**Usage Notes**:  
**符合**(fú hé) is used before nouns meaning "standards," "requirements," "conditions," etc. It does **not** take an object directly (unlike **适合**(shì hé): "to suit" someone/something).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of **符**(fú) as a "tally" or "token" that matches, and **合**(hé) as "combining" things. So **符合**(fú hé) means things "match up" or "fit together."
