# **与其 (yǔ qí) - rather than; instead of**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 与 (yǔ): means "with," "and," or "to give." Radical: 一 (yī) at top (means "one"); component 亅 (jué) at bottom.  
- 其 (qí): means "its," "his/her/their," or can replace a noun as "that one." Top: 八 (bā) spread atop; middle: 一 (yī); bottom: 儿 (ér) as a variant of feet/legs.

**Examples**:  
- 与其 (yǔ qí) 抱怨 (bào yuàn) 不如 (bù rú) 行动 (xíng dòng)。 (yǔ qí bào yuàn bù rú xíng dòng.) - Rather than complain, (it’s better to) take action.  
- 与其 (yǔ qí) 坐 (zuò) 着 (zhe) 等 (děng)，不如 (bù rú) 试试 (shì shì)。 (yǔ qí zuò zhe děng, bù rú shì shì.) - Instead of just waiting, try it.  
- 与其 (yǔ qí) 说 (shuō) 不如 (bù rú) 做 (zuò)。 (yǔ qí shuō bù rú zuò.) - Actions speak louder than words.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 与其 (yǔ qí)... 不如 (bù rú)... is the typical pattern ("rather than... it’s better to..."). Often used to compare two choices, suggesting the latter is preferable.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 与 (yǔ) looks like someone with outstretched arms "with" another. 其 (qí): Think of "that" being pinpointed by the two dots (八 bā) on top.  
- Remember: 与其 (yǔ qí) (rather than) sounds like "you choose?"-as in "you choose between two actions."
