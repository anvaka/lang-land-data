# **数字 (shùzì) - Number; Digit**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 数 (shù): means "number" or "to count." On the left is 攵 (pū, "knock"), representing action. On the right, 楚 (chǔ), historically for clarity or order, suggesting counting is an orderly action.  
- 字 (zì): means "character" or "word." Top is 宀 (mián, "roof"), bottom is 子 (zǐ, "child"), traditionally meaning "a child under a roof" learns characters.

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢学习数字。(Wǒ xǐhuān xuéxí shùzì.) - I like learning numbers.  
- 这个数字很大。(Zhège shùzì hěn dà.) - This number is very big.  
- 请写下你的手机数字。(Qǐng xiě xià nǐ de shǒujī shùzì.) - Please write down your phone number.

**Usage Notes**:  
数字 (shùzì) refers to both abstract numbers (math) and written digits. Often used for serial numbers, statistics, and phone numbers.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine 数 (shù) as "counting" with action (攵 pū), and 字 (zì) as "writing under a roof" (characters at home), so 数字 (shùzì) are "counted characters" = numbers.
