# **惹祸 (rě huò) - Cause trouble; make mischief**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **惹** (rě): Means "provoke" or "stir up." The left side is the "heart" radical 忄(xīn, left), indicating emotion or action; the right is 若 (ruò, right), which means "like" but here is for phonetic value.  
- **祸** (huò): Means "disaster" or "trouble." The left side is the "spirit" radical 礻(shì, left), related to gods/rituals; the right is 咼 (guō, right), for sound.

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 总是 (zǒng shì) 惹祸 (rě huò)。- He always causes trouble.  
- 她 (tā) 并不 (bìng bù) 想 (xiǎng) 惹祸 (rě huò)。- She doesn't want to make trouble.  
- 惹祸 (rě huò) 以后 (yǐ hòu)，他 (tā) 很 (hěn) 后悔 (hòu huǐ)。- After causing trouble, he regretted it.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 惹祸 (rě huò) is a verb-object phrase, often negative, describing someone bringing problems onto themselves or others.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine your "heart" (忄xīn) stirring up a "spirit" (礻shì) that brings disaster - when feelings stir, trouble follows!
