# **告诉 (gàosu) - to tell; to inform**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **告 (gào)**: Means "to tell, announce." Top: "牛 (niú)" (cow), suggesting an origin of offering cattle as a prayer; bottom: "口 (kǒu)" (mouth), relating to speech.  
- **诉 (sù)**: Means "to tell, relate." Left: "讠(yán)" (speech radical), relating to words; right: "斥 (chì)" (to blame/reprimand).

**Examples**:  
- 请告诉 (qǐng gàosu) 我 (wǒ) 你的 (nǐ de) 名字 (míngzi)。 - Please tell me your name.

**Memory Aids**:  
- "告诉 (gàosu)" starts with "告 (gào)" (to announce) and "诉 (sù)" (to speak)-so it’s “announcing by speaking”: to tell.  
- Imagine using your mouth "口 (kǒu)" (kǒu) to "announce" (告 gào) something, and "讠 (yán)" (speech radical) to "relate" (诉 sù) the message.
