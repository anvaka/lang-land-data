# **面貌 (miàn mào) - Appearance; Look**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **面 (miàn)**: "face," "surface." Radical is 面 (miàn) itself, representing a face or a flat surface.  
- **貌 (mào)**: "appearance," "features." Left: 豸 (zhì, beast radical), right: 白 (bái, white) + 勿 (wù), together indicating outward look.

**Examples**:  
- 他的面貌 (tā de miàn mào) 很友善 (hěn yǒu shàn)。- His appearance is friendly.  
- 城市的面貌 (chéng shì de miàn mào) 发生了变化 (fā shēng le biàn huà)。- The appearance of the city has changed.  
- 她有独特的面貌 (tā yǒu dú tè de miàn mào)。- She has unique features.

**Usage Notes**:  
面貌 (miàn mào) can refer to a person's facial features or the overall appearance of things (e.g., landscape, society). More formal than 脸 (liǎn, face).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: 面 (miàn, face) + 貌 (mào, look) = the "look of a face"; 面貌 (miàn mào) means appearance!
