# **竖 (shù) - Vertical, to erect**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 竖 (shù): Left - 立 (lì, "stand up") radical indicates standing or upright posture; right - 又 (yòu, "again/hand") adds meaning related to action or repetition.

**Examples**:  
- 请把书竖起来。(Qǐng bǎ shū shù qǐlái.) - Please stand the book upright.  
- 这条线是竖的。(Zhè tiáo xiàn shì shù de.) - This line is vertical.  
- 竖着写字比较难。(Shù zhe xiězì bǐjiào nán.) - Writing vertically is relatively difficult.

**Usage Notes**:  
竖 (shù) can be a verb ("to erect") or an adjective ("vertical"); opposes 横 (héng, "horizontal"). Common in descriptions of orientation or arrangement.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine 立 (lì, "stand") on the left, reminding you of standing tall; the whole character visually looks taller than wide-just like something vertical!
