# **明白 (míngbai) - to understand; clear**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 明 (míng): "bright, clear." Left: 日 (rì, "sun"); right: 月 (yuè, "moon"). Combined = brightness.  
- 白 (bái): "white, clear." Top: 丶 (dot); below: 日 (rì, "sun"). Suggests something as bright as the sun-white, obvious.

**Examples**:  
- 我明白了。(Wǒ míngbai le.) - I understand.  
- 你明白我的意思吗？(Nǐ míngbai wǒ de yìsi ma?) - Do you understand what I mean?  
- 他说得很明白。(Tā shuō de hěn míngbai.) - He explained it very clearly.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 明白 (míngbai) is both a verb ("to understand") and adjective ("clear, obvious").  
- Often used casually in spoken Chinese.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think: If it's as bright (明, míng) and clear (白, bái) as day, you can understand it!
