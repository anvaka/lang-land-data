# **逃 (táo) - to escape; to flee**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 逃(táo):
  - Left: 辶(chuò) "walk" radical, indicating movement.
  - Right: 兆(zhào) "omen/sign," lending the sound.

**Examples**:  
- 他(tā)想(xiǎng)逃(táo)跑(pǎo)。 (tā xiǎng táo pǎo.) - He wants to run away.  
- 小偷(xiǎo tōu)逃(táo)走(zǒu)了(le)。 (xiǎo tōu táo zǒu le.) - The thief ran away.  
- 动物(dòng wù)试图(shì tú)逃(táo)出(chū)笼(lóng)子(zi)。 (dòng wù shì tú táo chū lóng zi.) - The animal tried to escape from the cage.

**Usage Notes**:  
逃(táo) is often used with verbs like 跑(pǎo) (run), 走(zǒu) (go), or 出(chū) (out) for emphasis. Common in both literal and figurative contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine the "walk" radical 辶(chuò) on the left as legs running away, and the right part as a "sign" something is happening-so escape is moving away when you see a sign of danger.
