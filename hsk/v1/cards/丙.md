# **丙 (bǐng) - Third; "C" (used in sequences/classifications)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
丙 (bǐng)  
- Radical: 一 (yī, "one") on the top  
- Main structure: A combination of 一 (yī, "one") on top, below it a horizontal-vertical hook, and a final stroke at the bottom.  
- Origin: Pictographic representation; original oracle bone form symbolized a container with an opening, now used as the third of the "Heavenly Stems" (天干, tiāngān).

**Examples**:  
- 他被分在丙组。(tā bèi fēn zài bǐng zǔ.) - He was grouped in Group C.  
- 丙班明天考试。(bǐng bān míngtiān kǎoshì.) - Class C has an exam tomorrow.  
- 这题的答案选丙。(zhè tí de dá'àn xuǎn bǐng.) - The answer to this question is "C".

**Usage Notes**:  
丙 (bǐng) is mainly used as a label for "third" in sequences (like A/B/C), in legal or academic classifications, or to mean the third item (as in reports or documents).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think "Bǐng (丙)" is between "A (甲, jiǎ)" and "C (丁, dīng)", just like B is in the middle of A and C. The simple, straight strokes look like a simple ranking order.
