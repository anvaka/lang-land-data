# **寒假 (hán jià) - Winter vacation**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 寒 (hán): "cold." The top has 宀 (mián, roof), suggesting a house, with the lower part representing cold or chilly conditions.  
- 假 (jià): "vacation; leave." Left side is 亻(rén, person) and right side is 叚 (jiǎ, false/temporary), implying a person taking temporary leave.

**Examples**:  
- 我们的寒假 (wǒ men de hán jià) 很长 (hěn cháng) - Our winter vacation is long.  
- 寒假 (hán jià) 你打算做什么？(nǐ dǎ suàn zuò shén me?) - What do you plan to do during winter vacation?  
- 他寒假 (tā hán jià) 去旅行了 (qù lǚ xíng le) - He traveled during winter vacation.

**Usage Notes**:  
寒假 (hán jià) refers to the school break in winter, usually around January or February in China. Contrast with 暑假 (shǔ jià, summer vacation).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think "寒 (hán, cold) + 假 (jià, break)" = "a break when it's cold." Imagine staying inside(a "roof" on top in 寒(hán)) during the cold break.
