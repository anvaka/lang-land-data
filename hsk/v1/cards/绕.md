# **绕 (rào) - to wind; to go around; to detour**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **绕** (rào):
  - Left: **纟** (sī) “silk” radical - often relates to threads, string, or things that wind.
  - Right: **尧** (yáo) - a phonetic component, gives the sound; not much impact on meaning here.

**Examples**:  
- 我们需要绕 (rào) 过去。 (Wǒmen xūyào rào guòqù.) - We need to go around.  
- 河绕 (rào) 着山流。 (Hé rào zhe shān liú.) - The river winds around the mountain.  
- 他喜欢绕 (rào) 弯子说话。 (Tā xǐhuan rào wānzi shuōhuà.) - He likes to speak indirectly.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **绕** (rào) can be both verb and noun.  
- Often used with objects to specify what’s being circled: **绕路** (rào lù) = to take a detour.  
- Can be literal (physically circling) or figurative (speaking in a roundabout way).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Picture silk threads (**纟** (sī)) wrapping (winding) around something-just like how you might **绕** (rào) a ribbon around a gift.
