# **脚 (jiǎo) - Foot; leg**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 脚 (jiǎo):
  - Left: 月 (yuè) - "flesh" radical, suggests a body part.
  - Right: 却 (què) - provides pronunciation; originally means "retreat".

**Examples**:  
- 我的脚 (wǒ de jiǎo)疼。(téng) - My foot hurts.  
- 他用脚 (tā yòng jiǎo)踢球。(tī qiú) - He kicks the ball with his foot.  
- 小猫有四只脚 (xiǎo māo yǒu sì zhī jiǎo)。- The kitten has four feet.

**Usage Notes**:  
脚 (jiǎo) refers to the foot, and by extension, legs in animals. For "leg" (human), use 腿 (tuǐ).

**Memory Aids**:  
The left "flesh" side (月 yuè) hints it's a body part; think of the right side (却 què) as a person stepping back, showing their foot!
