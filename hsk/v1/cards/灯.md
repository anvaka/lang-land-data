# **灯 (dēng) - lamp, light**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **灯** (dēng): Left: **火** (huǒ, "fire" radical) suggests light/fire, placed on the left. Right: **丁** (dīng), phonetic component, means "nail" or "man" at the right. The character conveys an object related to fire/light.

**Examples**:  
- 请把灯(dēng)关掉。(Qǐng bǎ dēng guān diào.) - Please turn off the light.  
- 路灯(lù dēng)很亮。(Lù dēng hěn liàng.) - The streetlight is very bright.  
- 我需要一盏灯(yì zhǎn dēng)。 (Wǒ xūyào yì zhǎn dēng.) - I need a lamp.

**Usage Notes**:  
**灯** (dēng) is used for electric or oil lamps, lights, or lanterns. Common in compound words: **路灯** (lù dēng, streetlight), **灯泡** (dēng pào, light bulb), **红灯** (hóng dēng, red light/traffic light/red lantern).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of **火** (huǒ, fire) on the left-"fire" producing light; **丁** (dīng) on the right looks like a nail for "hanging" a lamp. Together, it's a "fire-nail": a lamp/light!
