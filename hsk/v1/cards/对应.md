# **对应 (duì yìng) - correspond, match; to be corresponding to**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **对** (duì): right, correct, to face. Left: "又" (yòu, again), right: "寸" (cùn, inch/hand). Together they imply two things meeting or facing each other.  
- **应** (yìng): to respond, answer, comply. Top: "广" (guǎng, shelter), bottom: "丶" (zhǔ, dot) + "心" (xīn, heart/mind, here modified). Suggests giving a response from the heart, or being appropriate.

**Examples**:  
- 请把中文单词和英文翻译对应起来。(qǐng bǎ zhōng wén dān cí hé yīng wén fān yì duì yìng qǐ lái.) - Please match the Chinese words with the English translations.  
- 他们的职位一一对应。(tā men de zhí wèi yī yī duì yìng.) - Their positions correspond one-to-one.  
- 你需要找到每条线所对应的颜色。(nǐ xū yào zhǎo dào měi tiáo xiàn suǒ duì yìng de yán sè.) - You need to find the color that corresponds to each line.

**Usage Notes**:  
**对应** (duì yìng) is typically used as a verb or adjective to describe things that match, correspond, or are in alignment with each other. Often used in formal, academic, or technical contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of **对** (duì, to face) as facing something, and **应** (yìng, responding) as answering. So "面对并回应" (miàn duì bìng huí yìng) - facing and responding = correspond/match.
