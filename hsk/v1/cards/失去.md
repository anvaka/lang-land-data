# **失去 (shīqù) - to lose; to miss**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **失 (shī)**: "to lose," "to miss." Radical: 大 (dà, "big") on top, with a small stroke (a dropped dot) on the right-top, and the lower part resembling 夫 (fū, "man").  
- **去 (qù)**: "to go;" in this word, used as "lost." Radical: 土 (tǔ, "earth") on the bottom, 厶 (sī, "private") on the top-right.

**Examples**:  
- 我 (wǒ) 失去 (shīqù) 了 (le) 信心 (xìnxīn)。 (I lost confidence.)  
- 他 (tā) 失去 (shīqù) 了 (le) 工作 (gōngzuò)。 (He lost his job.)  
- 不要 (bùyào) 失去 (shīqù) 希望 (xīwàng)。 (Don't lose hope.)

**Usage Notes**:  
- 失去 (shīqù) often conveys losing something abstract (hope, chance, confidence) or someone important, not physical objects.  
- For lost objects, use 丢 (diū) instead.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 失 (shī) looks like a "big" (大 dà) person "losing" a dot (something small) from their head.  
- 去 (qù) includes the 土 (tǔ) radical, imagine something "going away" into the ground-gone, lost.
