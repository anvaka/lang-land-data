# **月 (yuè) - Moon; Month**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **月 (yuè)**: Depicts a crescent moon. The character has two main strokes: a curved left side (vertical) and two short horizontal lines at the right (top and bottom right corners). Originally a pictogram for the moon.

**Examples**:  
- 今晚的月亮很圆。(Jīnwǎn de yuèliàng hěn yuán.) - The moon is very round tonight.  
- 一个月有三十天。(Yī gè yuè yǒu sānshí tiān.) - A month has thirty days.  
- 我下个月去中国。(Wǒ xià gè yuè qù Zhōngguó.) - I will go to China next month.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **月 (yuè)** means both "moon" and "month" depending on context: "月亮 (yuèliàng)" = moon (object); stand-alone "月 (yuè)" in dates = month.  
- Used in calendar terms: 一月 (yī yuè) = January, 二月 (èr yuè) = February, etc.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think of **月 (yuè)** as the crescent shape of the moon.  
- "月 (yuè)" sounds like "yue," reminding you of "you" gazing at the moon or counting months.
