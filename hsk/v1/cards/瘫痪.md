# **瘫痪 (tān huàn) - Paralysis; to be paralyzed**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **瘫 (tān):** Left: 疒 (nè, "sickness" radical); Right: 难 (nán, "difficult"). The sickness radical often relates to diseases.  
- **痪 (huàn):** Left: 疒 (nè, "sickness" radical); Right: 奐 (huàn, "magnificent," also a phonetic here). Both characters start with the "sickness" radical on the left.

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 因为 (yīn wèi) 车祸 (chē huò) 全身 (quán shēn) 瘫痪 (tān huàn) 了 (le)。 (He became completely paralyzed because of the car accident.)  
- 电脑 (diàn nǎo) 系统 (xì tǒng) 瘫痪 (tān huàn) 了 (le)。 (The computer system crashed.)  
- 下半身 (xià bàn shēn) 瘫痪 (tān huàn) 让 (ràng) 他 (tā) 无法 (wú fǎ) 行走 (xíng zǒu)。(Paralysis of the lower body made him unable to walk.)

**Usage Notes**:  
瘫痪 (tān huàn) can describe the medical condition (physical paralysis) or be used metaphorically (e.g., systems, traffic, organizations). As a verb or noun.

**Memory Aids**:  
Both characters have the "sick" radical 疒 (nè), relating to illness. 瘫痪 (tān huàn) sounds like "tan, Juan"-imagine someone so sick they "tan" (lie flat, unmoving) with "one" part of the body affected.
