# **斟酌 (zhēn zhuó) - To consider; to deliberate**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **斟 (zhēn)**: Left side is 斗 (dǒu, "measuring cup"), right side is 甚 (shèn, "very"); together, means "to pour (wine)" or "to consider carefully" (metaphor: measure carefully before pouring).  
- **酌 (zhuó)**: Left side is 酉 (yǒu, "wine jar", a wine-related radical), right side is 勺 (sháo, "ladle"); literally "to ladle out wine," figuratively "to weigh pros and cons."
