# **倒 (dǎo / dào) - to fall / to pour / inverted**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 倒 (dǎo / dào): Left side is ⺅(亻, rén, "person" radical, left), right side 到 (dào, "arrive"), suggesting a person arriving at an altered state.  
- Top of right side: 刀 (dāo, “knife”), bottom: 土 (tǔ, “earth”).

**Examples**:  
- 他倒了。(Tā dǎo le.) - He fell down.  
- 请把水倒进杯子里。(Qǐng bǎ shuǐ dào jìn bēizi lǐ.) - Please pour the water into the cup.  
- 结果正好相反，事情倒很顺利。(Jiéguǒ zhènghǎo xiāngfǎn, shìqing dào hěn shùnlì.) - The result was the opposite; things actually went smoothly.

**Usage Notes**:  
倒 (dǎo) usually means "fall over” (intransitive);  
倒 (dào) means "to pour, to invert" (transitive).  
Tone changes meaning-pay attention to context.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of a person (⺅(rén)) suddenly going to the ground (“arriving” at earth)-they “倒 (dǎo)” (fall down). Or, when you “倒 (dào)” (pour) tea, it’s like the liquid is “arriving” at another place.
