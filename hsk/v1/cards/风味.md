# **风味 (fēngwèi) - Flavor; local taste; distinctive style**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **风 (fēng)**: "wind." Radical: 风 (fēng) itself, looks like "𠘨" (top), "虫" (inside) in its full form; here it's the simplified version. Can suggest atmosphere or style.  
- **味 (wèi)**: "taste, flavor." Radical 口 (kǒu "mouth," left side), 未 (wèi "not yet," right side/top-bottom in the rest), refers to taste or sensation.

**Examples**:  
- 这里的菜有独特的风味。(Zhèlǐ de cài yǒu dútè de fēngwèi.) - The food here has a unique flavor.  
- 我喜欢尝试不同地方的风味。(Wǒ xǐhuān chángshì bùtóng dìfāng de fēngwèi.) - I like to try flavors from different places.  
- 北京的风味小吃很有名。(Běijīng de fēngwèi xiǎochī hěn yǒumíng.) - Beijing's local snacks are very famous.

**Usage Notes**:  
风味 (fēngwèi) often describes foods with distinct local characteristics (风味小吃 fēngwèi xiǎochī: local snacks), but can also refer to a unique atmosphere or style beyond food.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 风 (fēng) (wind) carrying different 味 (wèi) (tastes) from each place-unique flavors travel with the wind!
