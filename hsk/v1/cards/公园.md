# **公园 (gōngyuán) - park**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 公 (gōng): Means "public" or "common". Left is 八 (bā, "eight", split/divide) and right is 厶 (sī, "private"), representing "shared by all".  
- 园 (yuán): Means "garden" or "park". Outside is 囗 (wéi, "enclosure") and inside is 袁 (yuán, "a surname"), suggesting an enclosed area.

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢去公园。(Wǒ xǐhuan qù gōngyuán.) - I like going to the park.  
- 公园里有很多花和树。(Gōngyuán lǐ yǒu hěn duō huā hé shù.) - There are many flowers and trees in the park.  
- 孩子们在公园玩耍。(Háizimen zài gōngyuán wánshuǎ.) - Children are playing in the park.

**Usage Notes**:  
公园 (gōngyuán) is used for public parks/gardens, not for amusement parks (which is 游乐园 yóulèyuán). Prepositions like 在 (zài) commonly precede it.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine a 公 (gōng, "public") space inside an enclosed 园 (yuán, "garden")-that’s a park! Enclosures often mean "places" in Chinese.
