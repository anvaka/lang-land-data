# **标准 (biāo zhǔn) - Standard; Criterion**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 标 (biāo): On the left is 木 (mù, “wood” or “tree”), showing the radical component; on the right is 示 (shì, here as an altered form, “show/display”). 标 (biāo) originally relates to a sign or mark made on a tree.  
- 准 (zhǔn): Top is 冫 (bīng, “ice” radical), bottom is 隹 (zhuī, “short-tailed bird”). 准 (zhǔn) conveys notions of accuracy or criteria, as if aligning with a precise mark.

**Examples**:  
- 这是我们的标准。(Zhè shì wǒmen de biāo zhǔn.) - This is our standard.  
- 你达到了标准。(Nǐ dádào le biāo zhǔn.) - You have met the standard.  
- 每个人的标准不同。(Měi gè rén de biāo zhǔn bù tóng.) - Everyone’s standards are different.

**Usage Notes**:  
标准 (biāo zhǔn) is used as both a noun (“standard”) and an adjective (“standardized,” “of standard quality”). It commonly appears in education, quality control, and personal criteria contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
标 (biāo) includes 木 (mù, wood) - think of a “sign on a tree” setting a mark or standard. 准 (zhǔn) has 冫 (bīng, ice) - imagine “cold, precise standards” you must meet.
