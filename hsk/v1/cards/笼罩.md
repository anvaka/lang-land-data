# **笼罩 (lǒng zhào) - To shroud; to envelop; to cover**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **笼 (lǒng)**:
  - Radical: 竹 (zhú) "bamboo" on top
  - Bottom: 龙 (lóng) "dragon"; here, it means "cage," as bamboo was used to make cages.  
- **罩 (zhào)**:
  - Left: 网 (wǎng) "net" (like a cover/net)
  - Right: 卓 (zhuó) "outstanding"; the idea is of a cover placed over.

**Examples**:  
- 乌云笼罩着城市。(Wū yún lǒng zhào zhe chéng shì.) - Dark clouds shroud the city.  
- 夜色笼罩了大地。(Yè sè lǒng zhào le dà dì.) - Darkness enveloped the land.  
- 神秘的气氛笼罩着整个房间。(Shén mì de qì fēn lǒng zhào zhe zhěng gè fáng jiān.) - A mysterious atmosphere enveloped the entire room.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **笼罩 (lǒng zhào)** is often used for things that cover or envelop extensively and completely, especially abstractly (e.g., atmosphere, fog, emotion), not for tangible objects like clothes.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a dragon (**龙 lóng**) inside a bamboo cage (**笼 lǒng**), covered by a net (**网 wǎng**) - all shrouded and hidden, just like something being **笼罩 (lǒng zhào)**d!
