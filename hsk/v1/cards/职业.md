# **职业 (zhí yè) - Occupation; Profession**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **职 (zhí)**: Means "duty" or "post." Left side = 耳 (ěr, "ear" radical), right side = 只 (zhī, meaning "only," but here as a component).  
- **业 (yè)**: Means "profession" or "industry." Top = 一 (yī, "one"), middle = 八 (bā, "eight"), bottom = 小 (xiǎo, "small") stacked vertically.

**Examples**:  
- 你的职业是什么？(nǐ de zhí yè shì shén me?) - What is your occupation?  
- 他在选择职业。(tā zài xuǎn zé zhí yè.) - He is choosing a career.  
- 我的职业是医生。(wǒ de zhí yè shì yī shēng.) - My profession is a doctor.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **职业 (zhí yè)** is formal; use for jobs, careers, or fields of work.  
- Different from 工作 (gōng zuò, "job/work"), which can refer to both employment and the act of working.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think: Your "duty" (职 zhí) in your "profession" (业 yè) is your 职业 (zhí yè)!  
- 业 (yè) stacked levels = growth in your career.
