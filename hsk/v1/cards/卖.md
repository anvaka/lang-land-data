# **卖 (mài) - to sell**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **卖 (mài)**:
  - Top: "十 (shí) - ten" + "⺧ (niú) - ox/cow" component, merged as an old phonetic element.
  - Middle: "𠂉 (jiōng)" shape, sometimes indicating a roof/shelter.
  - Bottom: "买 (mǎi) - buy" without the top dot.
  - Overall: Picture of selling in a covered market or shop.

**Examples**:  
- 他在市场卖菜。(Tā zài shìchǎng mài cài.) - He sells vegetables at the market.  
- 这家店卖衣服。(Zhè jiā diàn mài yīfu.) - This store sells clothes.  
- 你想卖你的书吗？(Nǐ xiǎng mài nǐ de shū ma?) - Do you want to sell your book?

**Usage Notes**:  
- 卖 (mài) is usually followed by the object being sold.  
- Contrast with 买 (mǎi) (to buy)-be careful with tones!

**Memory Aids**:  
- 卖 (mài) is like 买 (mǎi) (buy) with extra detail on top-imagine adding something when you "sell."  
- Top of 卖 (mài) looks like a "hat" over 买 (mǎi); think of a vendor selling under a roof or stand.
