# **提醒 (tí xǐng) - to remind; to warn**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **提** (tí): “to lift; to raise; to mention.” Left: 提手旁/扌 (tíshǒupáng/shǒu, "hand" radical, left side) suggests an action by hand. Right: 是 (shì), serves as phonetic component.  
- **醒** (xǐng): “to wake up; to become aware.” Left: 酉 (yǒu, "wine" radical, left side) relates to fermentation/alcohol. Right: 星 (xīng, "star," right side), as a phonetic hint.

**Examples**:  
- 请你**提醒**(tíxǐng)我明天早上七点起床。(Qǐng nǐ tíxǐng wǒ míngtiān zǎoshang qī diǎn qǐchuáng.) - Please remind me to get up at 7 a.m. tomorrow.  
- 老师**提醒**(tíxǐng)学生按时交作业。(Lǎoshī tíxǐng xuéshēng ànshí jiāo zuòyè.) - The teacher reminds students to hand in homework on time.  
- 这个铃声是用来**提醒**(tíxǐng)你的。(Zhège língshēng shì yòng lái tíxǐng nǐ de.) - This bell is to remind you.

**Usage Notes**:  
Often followed by object (person) and action; e.g., **提醒**(tíxǐng) + someone + to do something. Use for both verbal and written reminders.

**Memory Aids**:  
Visualize “lifting” (提 tí) someone out of “sleepiness” (醒 xǐng)-reminding is like gently pulling someone toward awareness!
