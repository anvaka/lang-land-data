# **小姐 (xiǎojiě) - Miss; young lady**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 小 (xiǎo): small, little. Three short strokes: two at the top (representing smallness), one at the bottom.  
- 姐 (jiě): elder sister. Left: 女 (nǚ, woman radical); right: 且 (qiě, phonetic component).

**Examples**:  
- 王小姐 (Wáng xiǎojiě) - Miss Wang  
- 小姐，请问洗手间在哪里？(Xiǎojiě, qǐngwèn xǐshǒujiān zài nǎlǐ?) - Miss, may I ask where the restroom is?  
- 李小姐很友好。(Lǐ xiǎojiě hěn yǒuhǎo.) - Miss Li is very friendly.

**Usage Notes**:  
小姐 (xiǎojiě) is a polite way to address young, unmarried women. In some regions, term can carry informal or negative meaning (e.g., "hostess"), so use with care or default to 女士 (nǚshì, Ms./Madam) in formal/business settings.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think "small (小 xiǎo) woman (女 nǚ)" = young lady, and "elder sister (姐 jiě)" as a respectful address for women.
