# **报答 (bào dá) - to repay; to return (a favor)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **报 (bào)**: Left/side is 扌(shǒu, "hand" radical), right is 卩(jié) above, with 幸(xìng, "fortune/happiness") below-suggesting delivering news or returning something by hand.  
- **答 (dá)**: Top is 竹(zhú, "bamboo" radical), bottom is 合(hé, "combine")-origins from writing answers on bamboo slips.

**Examples**:  
- 我(wǒ)一定(yídìng)会(huì)报答(bàodá)你的(nǐde)帮助(bāngzhù)。 (Wǒ yídìng huì bàodá nǐ de bāngzhù.) - I will definitely repay your help.  
- 她(tā)想(xiǎng)报答(bàodá)父母(fùmǔ)的(de)养育(yǎngyù)之(zhī)恩(ēn)。 (Tā xiǎng bàodá fùmǔ de yǎngyù zhī ēn.) - She wants to repay her parents' nurturing grace.
