# **总和 (zǒng hé) - Sum; Total**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **总 (zǒng)**: Top is 公 (gōng, public/common), bottom is 心 (xīn, heart); together, it means "overall," "general."  
- **和 (hé)**: Left is 禾 (hé, grain), right is 口 (kǒu, mouth); means "and," "harmony," or "sum" in mathematics.

**Examples**:  
- 所有学生的分数总和是八百 (suǒ yǒu xué shēng de fēn shù zǒng hé shì bā bǎi) - The total of all students' scores is 800.  
- 这两项数据的总和很重要 (zhè liǎng xiàng shù jù de zǒng hé hěn zhòng yào) - The sum of these two data items is very important.  
- 总和比单项更有意义 (zǒng hé bǐ dān xiàng gèng yǒu yì yì) - The total is more meaningful than individual items.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 总和 (zǒng hé) is typically used in mathematics, statistics, or when summing up amounts, scores, or factors.  
- Commonly followed by 是 (shì, is) when stating a result.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 总 (zǒng): Think of the "public heart" as attention to the whole group-so, "total."  
- 和 (hé): Grain + mouth = sharing grain, leading to "harmony," or "combining" things into a sum.
