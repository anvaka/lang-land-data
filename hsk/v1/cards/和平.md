# **和平 (hé píng) - peace**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 和 (hé): Left = 禾 (hé, "grain") on the left; right = 口 (kǒu, "mouth") on the right. Historically, "peace" comes from "food/mouth"-when there's enough food, there's harmony.  
- 平 (píng): Top = 一 (yī, "one"); below = 丷 (bā, variant "eight") and 干 (gān, "dry/clean"). Means "flat, level, even."

**Examples**:  
- 世界需要和平。(Shìjiè xūyào hépíng.) - The world needs peace.  
- 我们希望有和平的生活。(Wǒmen xīwàng yǒu hépíng de shēnghuó.) - We hope for a peaceful life.  
- 和平很重要。(Hépíng hěn zhòngyào.) - Peace is very important.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 和平 (hépíng) is a noun, used for global peace or peaceful states. Not for "quiet" (use 安静 ānjìng).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a mouth (口 kǒu) and grain (禾 hé)-when people have food, there is peace (和 hé). "Flat/level" (平 píng) suggests calmness-flat waters mean peace.
