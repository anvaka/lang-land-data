# **胃 (wèi) - Stomach**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 胃 (wèi):
  - Left: ⺼/月 (ròu/yuè) - "flesh" radical, indicates relation to the body.
  - Right: 田 (tián) over 丸 (wán) - "field" over "pill"; here, mainly serves as phonetic.

**Examples**:  
- 我的胃痛。 (Wǒ de wèi tòng.) - My stomach hurts.  
- 他有胃病。 (Tā yǒu wèi bìng.) - He has a stomach illness.  
- 多喝水对胃好。 (Duō hē shuǐ duì wèi hǎo.) - Drinking more water is good for the stomach.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 胃 (wèi) refers specifically to the organ "stomach."  
- Common in medical or health contexts.  
- Often appears in compounds (e.g., 胃药 (wèi yào), "stomach medicine").

**Memory Aids**:  
- The ⺼/月 (ròu/yuè) radical reminds you it's body-related, and 田 (tián) looks like a compartment, like the stomach’s "chamber" for food.
