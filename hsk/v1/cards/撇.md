# **撇 (piě) - Left-falling stroke; to cast aside**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 撇 (piě):
  - Radical: 扌(shǒu) "hand" on the left (left side).
  - Right side: 㐅(yǐ) (resembles a shape component, not used alone).
  - Meaning: To throw away (with the hand); also denotes the name of the left-falling basic Chinese stroke.

**Examples**:  
- 这个汉字有一个撇。(Zhège hànzì yǒu yí gè piě.) - This Chinese character has a "piě" stroke.  
- 他把书撇在桌子上。(Tā bǎ shū piě zài zhuōzi shàng.) - He tossed the book onto the table.  
- 写“人”要先写撇。(Xiě "rén" yào xiān xiě piě.) - To write "rén," start with a "piě" stroke.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 撇 (piě) is both the name of a basic calligraphy stroke and a verb meaning "to cast aside" or "to neglect."  
- Common in handwriting/beginner stroke order lessons.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 撇 (piě) sounds like "pierce"; imagine your hand (扌 shǒu) swiftly "piercing" left-down, just like the stroke!
