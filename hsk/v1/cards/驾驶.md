# **驾驶 (jiàshǐ) - to drive; to pilot**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 驾 (jià): Left = 马 (mǎ, "horse") radical, right = 加 (jiā, "add"), together originally meant "to drive a carriage."  
- 驶 (shǐ): Left = 马 (mǎ, "horse") radical, right = 史 (shǐ, "history"); literally "to drive (a horse/vehicle)."

**Examples**:  
- 他正在驾驶汽车。(Tā zhèngzài jiàshǐ qìchē.) - He is driving a car.  
- 你会驾驶飞机吗？(Nǐ huì jiàshǐ fēijī ma?) - Can you pilot an airplane?  
- 驾驶需要专注力。(Jiàshǐ xūyào zhuānzhùlì.) - Driving requires concentration.

**Usage Notes**:  
驾驶 (jiàshǐ) is formal and used for driving vehicles, piloting planes, or operating ships. For casual "drive a car," 开车 (kāichē) is more common in conversation.

**Memory Aids**:  
Both 驾 (jià) and 驶 (shǐ) share the 马 (mǎ, "horse") radical, hinting at "driving/riding." Remember: If you can "add" (加, jiā) yourself to a horse, you "drive" it; and "history" (史, shǐ) shows how long we've been "driving."
