# **元素 (yuán sù) - Element**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 元 (yuán): Means "origin" or "primary." Top: 二 (èr) "two"; bottom: small "dot" suggests a head; together, represents "beginning/foundation."  
- 素 (sù): Means "basic," "plain," or "element." Left: 糸 (mì) "silk" radical; right: 𠬤 (sù) phonetic. Indicates something fundamental, like a basic material.

**Examples**:  
- 金属元素 (jīn shǔ yuán sù) - Chemical element/metal element  
- 水是生命的重要元素。(shuǐ shì shēng mìng de zhòng yào yuán sù) - Water is an important element of life.  
- 氧气是一种常见的元素。(yǎng qì shì yī zhǒng cháng jiàn de yuán sù) - Oxygen is a common element.

**Usage Notes**:  
元素 (yuán sù) is mostly scientific: chemistry, math, physics. For "factor/component," use 成分 (chéng fèn) or 因素 (yīn sù).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think "origin" (元 yuán) + "basic" (素 sù) = "original basic stuff" = element.  
"元 (yuán)" sounds like "yuan" (beginning), "素 (sù)" sounds like "suit"-think "the suit of basics = elements."
