# **品尝 (pǐncháng) - to taste; to sample**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **品 (pǐn)**: Top-bottom structure. Three 口 (kǒu, "mouth") stacked vertically, representing multiple people tasting and evaluating-thus "to savor, to taste, to judge."  
- **尝 (cháng)**: Top is 尝 (cháng) with “舌” (shé, "tongue") component under “尚” (shàng, "esteem")-implies using the tongue to try something, thus "to taste."

**Examples**:  
- 我想品尝(pǐncháng)这道菜。(Wǒ xiǎng pǐncháng zhè dào cài.) - I want to taste this dish.  
- 你可以品尝(pǐncháng)各种美食。(Nǐ kěyǐ pǐncháng gè zhǒng měishí.) - You can taste all kinds of delicacies.  
- 品尝(pǐncháng)新出的饮料很有趣。(Pǐncháng xīn chū de yǐnliào hěn yǒuqù.) - It’s fun to taste newly released drinks.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 品尝(pǐncháng) is formal; often used for food/drink sampling, culinary contexts, or events.  
- For daily eating, use 吃(chī) ("to eat") or 喝(hē) ("to drink").

**Memory Aids**:  
- 品(pǐn) = three mouths all savoring; 尝(cháng) = tongue (舌(shé)) under support-your tongue supports the tasting process!
