**Character Breakdown**:  
- 灵 (líng): Top is “雨” (yǔ, rain), bottom is “巫” (wū, shaman); suggests something spiritual or magical.  
- 感 (gǎn): Left side is “忄” (xīn, heart radical), right side is “咸” (xián, all/salty); expresses feeling or perception.

- 他的灵感很独特。(Tā de línggǎn hěn dútè.) - His inspiration is very unique.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 灵感 (línggǎn) is primarily a noun, referring to sudden creative ideas or inspiration, often in art or writing.  
- Often used with verbs like 有 (yǒu, to have), 得到 (dédào, to get), and 给 (gěi, to give).

**Memory Aids**:  
- 灵 (líng) is like "spirit" raining down; 感 (gǎn) is what the heart (忄,xīn) feels. Think: Inspiration is when the spirit "rains" feelings onto the heart.
