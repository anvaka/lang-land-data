**Character Breakdown**:  
- **敏** (mǐn): "quick, alert." Left: ⺾ (艹, cǎo) "grass" radical at the top; right: 每 (měi) at the bottom, which also means "every". Originally relates to agility.  
- **感** (gǎn): "feel, sense." Left: 咸 (xián) meaning "all"; right: 心 (xīn) "heart" at the bottom. Relates to internal feelings.
