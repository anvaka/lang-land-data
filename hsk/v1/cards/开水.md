# **开水 (kāi shuǐ) - Boiled Water**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **开 (kāi)**: "to open, to turn on"
  - Left: "廾 (gǒng)" (two hands), Right: "一 (yī)" (one) on top of "丨 (gǔn)" (line).  
- **水 (shuǐ)**: "water"
  - Central drop "丶 (zhǔ)" with three strokes: left, right, and bottom, representing flowing water.

**Examples**:  
- 请喝点开水。(Qǐng hē diǎn kāi shuǐ.) - Please have some boiled water.  
- 开水已经凉了。(Kāi shuǐ yǐ jīng liáng le.) - The boiled water has already cooled down.  
- 我帮你烧开水。(Wǒ bāng nǐ shāo kāi shuǐ.) - I'll boil water for you.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 开水 (kāi shuǐ) means water that has been boiled, commonly used for safety and in daily life.  
- Unlike 水 (shuǐ), which refers to any water, 开水 (kāi shuǐ) emphasizes it's been boiled.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine you "open" (开 kāi) the heat to water (水 shuǐ), then it becomes boiled water (开水 kāi shuǐ).  
- The strokes in 水 (shuǐ) resemble drops and streams-think of water boiling energetically.
