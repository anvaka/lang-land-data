# **更 (gèng) - more; even more**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 更 (gèng): The top is “一” (yī) meaning "one", the middle element depicts a "stop" (止 zhǐ) radical, with extra marks at the bottom. Originally, it suggested "to change" or "to replace." Now it often means "more" or indicates a comparison.

**Examples**:  
- 我想要更好。(Wǒ xiǎng yào gèng hǎo.) - I want (something) even better.  
- 天气更冷了。(Tiānqì gèng lěng le.) - The weather is even colder.  
- 他跑得更快。(Tā pǎo de gèng kuài.) - He runs even faster.

**Usage Notes**:  
- Typically placed before adjectives/adverbs to express "even more" (e.g., 更大 gèng dà - bigger).  
- Used for direct comparison, often without needing 比 (bǐ).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think “更 (gèng)” as adding “extra” on “top” of something, just as the horizontal stroke is stacked above-meaning “more.”
