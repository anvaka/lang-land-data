# **北方 (běi fāng) - North / Northern region**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **北 (běi)**: Top features two 人 (rén, "person") radicals facing away; originally means "back to back," symbolizing "north" (anciently, people faced the sun, so north was behind them).  
- **方 (fāng)**: Enclosure ⌜丶 (zhǔ, "dot") at top left and square 匚 (fāng, "box") radical; means "direction" or "region".

**Examples**:  
- 我住在北方。(Wǒ zhù zài běi fāng.) - I live in the north.  
- 北方冬天很冷。(Běi fāng dōng tiān hěn lěng.) - Northern winters are very cold.  
- 他从北方来。(Tā cóng běi fāng lái.) - He comes from the north.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 北方 (běi fāng) refers to northern China or the general north in geography, and contrasts with 南方 (nán fāng, "south").  
- Use as a noun: "北方人 (běi fāng rén)" = northerner.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 北 (běi): Two people (人 rén) back-to-back, facing away from the cold north.  
- 方 (fāng): Think of a map's direction box ("compass rose") for "direction".
