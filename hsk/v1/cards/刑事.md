# **刑事 (xíngshì) - Criminal; criminal case**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **刑** (xíng): Means "punishment" or "penalty." Left side is "刂" (dāo, knife radical) indicating relation to cutting/punishment, right side is "开" (kāi, open).  
- **事** (shì): Means "matter," "affair," or "event." Top is "一" (yī, one), middle is "口" (kǒu, mouth), bottom is "亅" (jué, hook) - taken together as "affair to be handled."

**Examples**:  
- 这是一起刑事案件。(Zhè shì yī qǐ xíngshì ànjiàn.) - This is a criminal case.  
- 警方正在调查刑事行为。(Jǐngfāng zhèngzài diàochá xíngshì xíngwéi.) - The police are investigating criminal behavior.  
- 刑事责任非常严重。(Xíngshì zérèn fēicháng yánzhòng.) - Criminal responsibility is very serious.

**Usage Notes**:  
**刑事** (xíngshì) is used for criminal (as opposed to civil) matters. Common in legal terms: **刑事案件** (xíngshì ànjiàn, criminal case), **刑事责任** (xíngshì zérèn, criminal liability).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think **刑** (xíng, punishment) + **事** (shì, affair) = "matters involving crime." Imagine a judge (事) holding a knife (刑) to remember "criminal affair."
