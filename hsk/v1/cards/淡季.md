# **淡季 (dànjì) - Off-season / Low season**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 淡 (dàn): means "light," "faint," "weak" or "bland." Left: 氵(shuǐ, water radical), indicates relation to liquid or lightness; right: 炎 (yán, flame) suggests heat, but together gives "not intense."  
- 季 (jì): means "season." Top: 禾 (hé, grain), suggests crops; bottom: 子 (zǐ, child), often related to offspring or generation.

**Examples**:  
- 现在是旅游淡季。(Xiànzài shì lǚyóu dànjì.) - Now is the travel off-season.  
- 淡季机票比较便宜。(Dànjì jīpiào bǐjiào piányí.) - Air tickets are cheaper during the low season.  
- 淡季时生意不好。(Dànjì shí shēngyì bù hǎo.) - Business is not good during the off-season.

**Usage Notes**:  
淡季 (dànjì) is often used for tourism, business, and retail to describe periods of low demand. Opposite: 旺季 (wàngjì, peak season).

**Memory Aids**:  
淡 (dàn, light/bland) season-think: the "flavor" of business is light, not strong; activities are less intense.
