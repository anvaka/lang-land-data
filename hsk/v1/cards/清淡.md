# **清淡 (qīngdàn) - light (in flavor), mild**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **清** (qīng): "clear, pure." Left: "氵" (shuǐ, water radical) indicates relation to water. Right: "青" (qīng, blue/green) adds sound and purity sense.  
- **淡** (dàn): "light, weak." Left: "氵" (shuǐ, water radical), suggests connection with liquid or flavor. Right: "炎" (yán, flame) above "丶" (dot), representing diluted intensity.

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢清淡的菜。(Wǒ xǐhuān qīngdàn de cài.) - I like light-flavored dishes.  
- 这种汤味道很清淡。(Zhè zhǒng tāng wèidào hěn qīngdàn.) - This kind of soup is very mild in flavor.  
- 医生建议他吃清淡食物。(Yīshēng jiànyì tā chī qīngdàn shíwù.) - The doctor recommends he eat light food.

**Usage Notes**:  
**清淡** (qīngdàn) describes mild flavors, low oil, light colors, or even "calm" business (e.g., 生意清淡 shēngyì qīngdàn means slow business). Commonly used to describe food.

**Memory Aids**:  
**清** (qīng) and **淡** (dàn) both have "水" (shuǐ, water) radical, which reminds you of "watered-down" flavors-think of a soup with lots of water making it taste light.
