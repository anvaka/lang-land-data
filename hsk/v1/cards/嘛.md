# **嘛 (ma) - Modal particle (used for emphasis/suggestion)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 嘛 (ma):
  - Radical: 口 (kǒu, "mouth") on the left (left side: speech/voice).
  - Component: 麻 (má, "hemp") on the right (right side: phonetic component).
  - Originally extended from "麻 (má)", used for its sound in speech-related contexts.

**Examples**:  
- 你快说嘛！(nǐ kuài shuō ma!) - Just say it already!  
- 我不知道嘛。(wǒ bù zhī dào ma.) - I really don’t know!  
- 他还小嘛。(tā hái xiǎo ma.) - He’s still young, you know.

**Usage Notes**:  
嘛 (ma) is a sentence-final particle for emphasis, persuasion, or obviousness. Softer than 呢 (ne) or 吧 (ba), commonly used in spoken Mandarin to add tone or emotion.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of the "mouth (口 kǒu)" radical-嘛 (ma) is used by people speaking to soften or emphasize requests/suggestions, like adding a gentle "c'mon!" in English.
