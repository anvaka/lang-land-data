# **寓言 (yùyán) - Fable**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **寓 (yù)**: On the "left" is "宀 (mián)" radical (roof), indicating "house"; on the "right" is "禹 (yǔ)" (ancient name), suggesting a "person". Together, it means "to reside" or "to lodge"; by extension, "to imply" or "to express by analogy."  
- **言 (yán)**: "Top" has "亠 (tóu)" (lid), "bottom" is "口 (kǒu)" (mouth)-the whole character means "speech" or "word".

**Usage Notes**:  
寓言(yùyán) is a noun. Used to describe stories with morals, often involving animals or personified things. Common in literature and education.

**Memory Aids**:  
寓(yù) = "reside" + "imply", 言(yán) = "words" ⇒ 寓言(yùyán): "words that hold a deeper, hidden home (meaning)". Imagine a story where the real lesson "lives inside" the words.
