# **宰 (zǎi) - to slaughter; to overcharge; master**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 宀 (mián, "roof") on top: radical for "building" or "house".  
- ⿱ (top/bottom structure):
  - Top: 宀 (mián, "roof")
  - Bottom: 辛 (xīn, "bitter; suffering"), meaning "toil," often associated with hardship or labor.  
- Together: originally referred to one who manages affairs in a home or temple (a "master"), later acquired the meanings: "to slaughter," "to overcharge."

**Examples**:  
- 屠夫正在宰(zǎi)猪。(Túfū zhèngzài zǎi zhū.) - The butcher is slaughtering the pig.  
- 那家店宰(zǎi)顾客。(Nà jiā diàn zǎi gùkè.) - That shop rips off its customers.  
- 宰(zǎi)相是古代的重要官职。(Zǎixiàng shì gǔdài de zhòngyào guānzhí.) - "Zai" (Prime Minister) was an important official position in ancient times.

**Usage Notes**:  
- As a verb: mainly means to "slaughter (animals)," or colloquially to "rip off" (overcharge).  
- As a noun: used in ancient titles like 宰(zǎi)相(zhàng) (Prime Minister).  
- Formal and informal usage differ; clarify by context.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a "roof" over "hard work" (辛 xīn): the person in charge under the roof does hard tasks-sometimes even slaughtering or charging high prices!
