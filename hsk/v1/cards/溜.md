# **溜 (liū) - to slip, to slide, to sneak away**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **溜 (liū)**: Left side is "氵(shuǐ)" (water radical, left), suggesting association with fluidity or movement; right side is "㐬(liù)" (right), provides the sound component.

**Examples**:  
- 他偷偷溜出了教室。(tā tōu tōu liū chū le jiào shì.) - He secretly slipped out of the classroom.  
- 小猫在地上溜来溜去。(xiǎo māo zài dì shang liū lái liū qù.) - The kitten is sliding back and forth on the floor.  
- 我们快点溜走吧！(wǒ men kuài diǎn liū zǒu ba!) - Let’s sneak away quickly!

**Usage Notes**:  
**溜 (liū)** is commonly used for moving quietly and quickly-often escaping, sliding, or sneaking. Sometimes duplicated for emphasis (e.g. **溜走 (liū zǒu)**: sneak away).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of "water (氵, shuǐ)" slipping away easily-**溜 (liū)** is like water quietly sliding off a surface.
