# **流浪 (liú làng) - To wander; to roam; to be homeless**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **流 (liú)**: "To flow", radical 氵(water, left), 旈 (right) meaning “to drift, to float,” referring to movement like flowing water.  
- **浪 (làng)**: "Wave" or "wandering," radical 氵(water, left), 良 (right) meaning “good; virtuous”-here lending the sound, but together represents "waves" or "to wander like waves."

**Examples**:

**Usage Notes**:  
- 流浪 (liú làng) often describes people or animals without a home, or the act of aimless roaming.  
- As a verb, can be used literally ("to roam") or metaphorically (drifting through life).

**Memory Aids**:  
- 流 (liú) is "flow" (like water moving); 浪 (làng) is "wave." Imagine waves (浪 làng) flowing (流 liú) endlessly-just like someone who is 流浪 (liú làng): wandering with no fixed direction.
