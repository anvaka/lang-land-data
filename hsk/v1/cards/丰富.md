# **丰富 (fēngfù) - Rich; Abundant**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 丰 (fēng): "Plentiful." Top horizontal strokes symbolize piles of grain; bottom is simple, representing abundance.  
- 富 (fù): "Wealthy." Top is 宀 (mián, "roof"), under which there's 畐 (fú, "full" or "filled"), symbolizing a house full of goods = wealth.

**Examples**:  
- 他的经验很丰富。(Tā de jīngyàn hěn fēngfù.) - His experience is very rich.  
- 这本书内容丰富。(Zhè běn shū nèiróng fēngfù.) - This book's content is abundant.  
- 他们过着丰富的生活。(Tāmen guò zhe fēngfù de shēnghuó.) - They live a rich (fulfilling) life.

**Usage Notes**:  
丰富 (fēngfù) is mainly used as an adjective to describe intangible things (e.g., knowledge, experience, imagination), not physical countable objects.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 丰 (fēng, abundant) + 富 (fù, wealth) = "abundant in wealth" = "rich/abundant" in anything.
