# **读 (dú) - to read; to study**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 读 (dú):
  - Left: 讠(yán) radical (speech/words, hinting at language/communication)
  - Right: 卖 (mài, "to sell") without the "head" at top, indicating phonetic part.

**Examples**:  
- 我正在读书。(wǒ zhèng zài dú shū.) - I am reading a book.  
- 请大声读出来。(qǐng dà shēng dú chū lái.) - Please read aloud.  
- 他会读中文。(tā huì dú zhōng wén.) - He can read Chinese.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 读 (dú) is mainly used for reading written text and for "study" in certain contexts (e.g., 读大学 (dú dà xué) - to study at university).  
- Different from 看 (kàn, to look/see), which may also mean "to read" a newspaper, but 读 (dú) emphasizes the act of reading itself.

**Memory Aids**:  
- The left side 讠(yán) reminds you reading involves words, and the whole character 读 (dú) "sells" (卖 mài) knowledge through reading.
