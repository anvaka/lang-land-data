**Character Breakdown**:  
- 从 (cóng): Left/right arrangement. The left side is 人 (rén, "person"), and the right is also a smaller 人 (rén), indicating two people. It originally means "to follow" or "followers." Now commonly means "from."

- Shows starting point or origin in time or space.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine two people (人 rén) walking together: one is following "from" behind the other-just like how 从 (cóng) shows "from/follow."
