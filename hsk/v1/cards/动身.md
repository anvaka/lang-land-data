# **动身 (dòng shēn) - to set off; to leave**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **动 (dòng)**: Means "to move." Left: 动 (dòng) has the "云 (yún, cloud)" component on top and "力 (lì, strength)" on the bottom, implying movement with force.  
- **身 (shēn)**: Means "body." Top: 身 (shēn) resembles a pictograph of a person bending, indicating the physical body.

- 她准备动身去北京 (tā zhǔn bèi dòng shēn qù běi jīng) - She is preparing to leave for Beijing.  
- 动身前别忘了带护照 (dòng shēn qián bié wàng le dài hù zhào) - Don’t forget your passport before setting off.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 动身 (dòng shēn) is generally used for beginning a journey or moving from one location to another, often with some planning.  
- Often paired with time expressions (e.g., 一早 (yī zǎo), 明天 (míng tiān), etc.).

**Memory Aids**:  
- 动 (dòng) = "move" + 身 (shēn) = "body" → When your body moves, you set off!  
- Imagine your "moving body (动身 dòng shēn)" walking out the door to begin a trip.
