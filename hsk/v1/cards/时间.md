# **时间 (shíjiān) - Time**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 时 (shí): Left/side is 日 (rì) "sun", right/side is 寸 (cùn) "inch" → related to time/season.  
- 间 (jiān): Outside/enclosure is 门 (mén) "door", inside is 日 (rì) "sun" → originally "sun between doors", now refers to interval or space.

**Examples**:  
- 你有时间吗？(nǐ yǒu shíjiān ma?) - Do you have time?  
- 时间过得很快。(shíjiān guò de hěn kuài.) - Time passes quickly.  
- 请给我一点时间。(qǐng gěi wǒ yì diǎn shíjiān.) - Please give me some time.

**Usage Notes**:  
时间 (shíjiān) is a noun meaning "time" (as a general, uncountable concept). For specific moments, use 时候 (shíhòu).

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine the sun (日, rì) moving through the door (门, mén) to track time; "measuring the sun" gives you 时间 (shíjiān)!
