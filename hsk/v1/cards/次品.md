# **次品 (cìpǐn) - Defective product; substandard goods**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **次 (cì)**: Next; secondary. Radical "欠 (qiàn)" (right: "owe") + top/left "冫(bīng)" (ice); originally related to sequence/order.  
- **品 (pǐn)**: Product; item. Three stacked "口 (kǒu)" (mouth: top/middle/bottom), signifying many things/items.

**Examples**:  
- 这台电视是次品。(Zhè tái diànshì shì cìpǐn.) - This TV is a defective product.  
- 我拒绝购买次品。(Wǒ jùjué gòumǎi cìpǐn.) - I refuse to buy substandard goods.  
- 超市有时会降价出售次品。(Chāoshì yǒu shí huì jiàngjià chūshòu cìpǐn.) - Sometimes supermarkets sell defective goods at a discount.

**Usage Notes**:  
"次品 (cìpǐn)" is a noun, often used formally/officially for goods not meeting quality standards. Opposite: "正品 (zhèngpǐn)" (genuine product).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "次 (cì)" is 'second-rate,' and "品 (pǐn)" is 'goods'-so "次品 (cìpǐn)" = 'second-rate goods.'
