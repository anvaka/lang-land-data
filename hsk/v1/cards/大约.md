# **大约 (dà yuē) - approximately; about**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **大 (dà)**: means "big"; top: "一 (yī)" (one), middle: "丨 (gǔn)" (line), bottom: "人 (rén)" (person with arms spread wide).  
- **约 (yuē)**: means "approximately" or "to make an appointment"; left: "纟(sī)" (silk radical), right: "勺 (sháo)" (spoon), suggesting something "tied together," i.e., roughly or approximately.

**Examples**:  
- 我们大约(dà yuē)三点出发。(Wǒmen dà yuē sān diǎn chū fā.) - We will leave at about three o'clock.  
- 这里有大约(dà yuē)五十个人。(Zhè lǐ yǒu dà yuē wǔ shí gè rén.) - There are approximately fifty people here.  
- 飞机大约(dà yuē)十点到达。(Fēi jī dà yuē shí diǎn dào dá.) - The plane arrives at about ten o'clock.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **大约(dà yuē)** is used before numbers to indicate approximation.  
- Similar to "about" or "approximately" in English.  
- Can be used with time, quantity, or measurement.

**Memory Aids**:  
- **大(dà)** means "big"-think "a big guess."  
- **约(yuē)** looks like a "silk thread" tying two things together loosely, so it’s not precise-just an approximation.
