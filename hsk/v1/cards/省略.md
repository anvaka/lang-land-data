# **省略 (shěnglüè) - Omit; leave out**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 省 (shěng): "to save," "omit." Top: 少 (shǎo) "few," Bottom: 目 (mù) "eye." Originally means "to examine," now also "to omit."  
- 略 (lüè): "brief," "outline." Left: 田 (tián) "field," Right: each (各 gè) "each." Suggests "overview" or "sketch."

**Examples**:  
- 请 (qǐng) 省略 (shěnglüè) 这些 (zhèxiē) 细节 (xìjié). (Please omit these details.)  
- 他 (tā) 把 (bǎ) 一些 (yìxiē) 信息 (xìnxī) 省略了 (shěnglüèle). (He has omitted some information.)  
- 句子 (jùzi) 中 (zhōng) 省略了 (shěnglüèle) 主语 (zhǔyǔ). (The subject is omitted in the sentence.)

**Usage Notes**:  
省略 (shěnglüè) is often used in writing or grammar to indicate parts left out for brevity or when context is understood.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 省 (shěng) as "eye" (目 mù) saving (省 shěng) you from looking at extra words, and 略 (lüè) as a "field" (田 tián) sketch-just the outline, not the detail.
