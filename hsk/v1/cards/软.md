# **软 (ruǎn) - soft**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 软 (ruǎn): Left-“车 (chē)” (cart, radical meaning movement or transport); Right-“欠 (qiàn)” (to owe or yawn). Together, originally related to flexible movement.

**Examples**:  
- 这个床很软。(Zhè ge chuáng hěn ruǎn.) - This bed is very soft.  
- 面包变软了。(Miànbāo biàn ruǎn le.) - The bread has become soft.  
- 他说话声音很软。(Tā shuōhuà shēngyīn hěn ruǎn.) - His speaking voice is soft.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 软 (ruǎn) is both adjective (soft, flexible) and in compounds like 软体 (ruǎntǐ - software).  
- Opposite: 硬 (yìng - hard).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a “car (车 chē)” so comfortable it feels “soft (软 ruǎn),” and after a long ride, you “yawn (欠 qiàn)” and melt into something soft.
