# **饿 (è) - hungry**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 饿 (è): Left side is the “饣”(shí) radical (related to food), positioned on the left. Right side is “我”(wǒ), meaning “I, me,” on the right. The presence of the food radical suggests the meaning is related to eating.

**Examples**:  
- 我饿了。(Wǒ è le.) - I’m hungry.  
- 你饿不饿？(Nǐ è bù è?) - Are you hungry?  
- 他很饿。(Tā hěn è.) - He is very hungry.

**Usage Notes**:  
“饿”(è) is often followed by “了”(le) to indicate a present/changed state ("hungry now"). Common in daily speech.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: “I (我 wǒ) by food (饣 shí) = hungry (饿 è).” If you (我 wǒ) see food (饣 shí) but don’t have it, you feel “hungry” (饿 è)!
