# **把握 (bǎ wò) - Grasp; seize; assurance**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **把** (bǎ): Means "to hold; handle." Left is 扌 (shǒu, hand radical, left side), right is 巴 (bā, phonetic, right side).  
- **握** (wò): Means "to grasp." Left is 扌 (shǒu, hand radical, left side), right is 屋 (wū, house, right side).

**Examples**:  
- 请(Qǐng)把握(bǎwò)机会(jīhuì)。 - Please seize the opportunity.  
- 我(wǒ)没有(méiyǒu)把握(bǎwò)回答(huídá)这个(zhège)问题(wèntí)。 - I am not confident about answering this question.  
- 他(tā)对(duì)成功(chénggōng)很(hěn)有(yǒu)把握(bǎwò)。 - He is quite confident about succeeding.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **把握** (bǎwò) as a verb: physically grasp or figuratively seize (opportunity, chance).  
- As a noun: "confidence" or "assurance" (e.g., 有把握(yǒu bǎwò) = to have confidence).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine using both "hands" (扌(shǒu)) to "hold" (把(bǎ)) onto something tightly in a "house" (屋(wū))-that is true "grasp" or "assurance."
