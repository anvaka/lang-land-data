# **剥削 (bō xuē) - Exploit / Exploitation**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 剥 (bō): "Peel, strip" - Left side is 刂 (dāo, "knife" radical) for "cut," right side is 皮 (pí, "skin") for "what is being peeled."  
- 削 (xuē): "Cut, pare" - Left side is also 刂 (dāo, "knife"), right side is 肖 (xiào/xuē), depicting "resembling," here pronounced xuē.

**Examples**:  
- 工人被剥削了。(Gōng rén bèi bō xuē le.) - Workers were exploited.  
- 剥削贫困的人是不道德的。(Bō xuē pín kùn de rén shì bù dào dé de.) - Exploiting poor people is immoral.  
- 他们反对资本家的剥削。(Tā men fǎn duì zī běn jiā de bō xuē.) - They oppose capitalist exploitation.

**Usage Notes**:  
剥削 (bō xuē) often refers to unfair use of someone’s labor or resources for personal gain. Common in social, economic, or political contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
剥 (bō) and 削 (xuē) both have the "knife" radical 刂 (dāo), hinting at "cutting/peeling," which fits the idea of "stripping" value from others. Visualize someone using a knife to peel (剥 bō) and shave off (削 xuē) what belongs to someone else-like exploitation.
