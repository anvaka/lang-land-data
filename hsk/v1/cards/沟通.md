# **沟通 (gōu tōng) - Communication**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **沟 (gōu)**: "Ditch" or "canal." Left: "氵" (three water dots, "water" radical) indicating relation to water. Right: "勾" (gōu), meaning "hook," here acts phonetically.  
- **通 (tōng)**: "To go through; to connect." Left: "辶" (walk/movement radical) at the bottom, suggesting motion. Right/top: "甬" (yǒng), meaning "to go straight"; provides pronunciation.

**Examples**:  
- 我们需要有效沟通。(Wǒmen xūyào yǒuxiào gōutōng.) - We need effective communication.  
- 他很擅长和别人沟通。(Tā hěn shàncháng hé biérén gōutōng.) - He is good at communicating with others.  
- 沟通能解决很多问题。(Gōutōng néng jiějué hěn duō wèntí.) - Communication can solve many problems.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **沟通 (gōutōng)** is both a noun and a verb; often used for exchanging ideas, feelings, or negotiating.  
- Common collocations: "有效沟通 (yǒuxiào gōutōng, effective communication)", "沟通能力 (gōutōng nénglì, communication skills)".

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a **沟 (gōu)** (ditch/canal) brings **水 (shuǐ, water)** (left radical) together, while **通 (tōng)** (connects) people by helping ideas "flow through" barriers-communication is like water traveling through a channel.
