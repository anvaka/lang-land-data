# **终究 (zhōng jiū) - After all; in the end; eventually**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **终 (zhōng)**: "end, finish." Radical: 纟(sī, "silk," on the left); phonetic: 冬(dōng, "winter," on the right); suggests the "end of a thread."  
- **究 (jiū)**: "after all, investigate, study." Radical: 穴(xué, "cave," on top); component: 九(jiǔ, "nine," on the bottom); originally related to investigating deeply into something.

**Examples**:  
- 他( tā ) 终究( zhōng jiū ) 会( huì ) 明白( míng bái )。 (Tā zhōng jiū huì míng bái.) - He will understand in the end.  
- 我们( wǒ men ) 终究( zhōng jiū ) 要( yào ) 面对( miàn duì ) 现实( xiàn shí )。 (Wǒ men zhōng jiū yào miàn duì xiàn shí.) - We must face reality eventually.  
- 真理( zhēn lǐ ) 终究( zhōng jiū ) 会( huì ) 胜利( shèng lì )。 (Zhēn lǐ zhōng jiū huì shèng lì.) - Truth will prevail in the end.

**Usage Notes**:  
终究 (zhōng jiū) is an adverb used to emphasize an inevitable result, often after a process or delay. It is more formal than 最后 (zuì hòu, "finally") and is often used in written or reflective speech.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "终 (zhōng, end) + 究 (jiū, investigate deeply) = After investigating to the end, you END UP with a result-eventually!"
