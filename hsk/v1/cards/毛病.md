# **毛病 (máo bìng) - Problem; defect; fault**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **毛 (máo)**: "fur, hair" - The radical ⺾ (cǎo, "grass") is on the top, the rest below. Used metaphorically for something minor or small.  
- **病 (bìng)**: "illness, disease" - The radical 疒 (nè, "sickness") is on the left, 丙 (bǐng) on the right. Refers broadly to sickness or problems.

**Examples**:  
- 这台电脑有毛病。(Zhè tái diànnǎo yǒu máobìng.) - This computer has a problem.  
- 他的性格有点毛病。(Tā de xìnggé yǒudiǎn máobìng.) - There’s something wrong with his personality.  
- 你发现哪里有毛病了吗？(Nǐ fāxiàn nǎlǐ yǒu máobìng le ma?) - Did you notice where the problem is?

**Usage Notes**:  
毛病 (máobìng) is used for both physical and abstract problems (e.g., faults in machines, quirks in people, bad habits). Common in informal speech.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "毛 (máo)" (hair: something small) + "病 (bìng)" (illness) = "small illness," or a minor defect/problem.
