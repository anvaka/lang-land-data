# **尖锐 (jiān ruì) - Sharp; acute; keen**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **尖** (jiān): Top component 小 (xiǎo, "small"); bottom component 大 (dà, "big"). Originally depicted something coming to a fine point-hence "sharp" or "pointed."  
- **锐** (ruì): Left radical 钅(jīn, "metal") indicating relation to metal or sharpness; right component 兑 (duì) often related to "exchange" but here contributes to sound. Overall, means "sharp" or "keen" (often of tools or senses).

**Examples**:  
- 这把刀很尖锐。(Zhè bǎ dāo hěn jiān ruì.) - This knife is very sharp.  
- 他提出了尖锐的问题。(Tā tí chū le jiān ruì de wèn tí.) - He raised sharp/pointed questions.  
- 意见分歧非常尖锐。(Yì jiàn fēn qí fēi cháng jiān ruì.) - The differences in opinion are very acute.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **尖锐** (jiān ruì) can describe physical sharpness (like knives), as well as abstract sharpness, such as sharp comments, acute problems, or keen observations. Often used for figurative, critical, or controversial topics.

**Memory Aids**:  
- **尖** (jiān): Picture something "small" (小, xiǎo) above something "big" (大, dà) forming a point-sharp!  
- **锐** (ruì): The "metal" (钅, jīn) radical indicates sharp tools; think of a keen blade.  
Use **尖锐** (jiān ruì) when something is literally or metaphorically cutting!
