# **过失 (guò shī) - Fault; Mistake; Negligence**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 过 (guò): "to pass; to cross; to exceed; fault". Left: "辶" (chuò, movement radical) suggests motion, bottom-left to right; right: "咼" (guō), part of phonetic component.  
- 失 (shī): "to lose; to miss; mistake". Top: "丿" (piě, slash); middle: "夫" (fū, man); combined suggest divergence or separation, symbolizing error.

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 因为 (yīn wèi) 过失 (guò shī) 被 (bèi) 批评 (pī píng) 了 (le)。 (He was criticized for his mistake.)  
- 这是 (zhè shì) 我 (wǒ) 的 (de) 过失 (guò shī)，我 (wǒ) 道歉 (dào qiàn)。 (This was my fault, I apologize.)  
- 法律 (fǎ lǜ) 要 (yào) 追究 (zhuī jiū) 过失 (guò shī) 行为 (xíng wéi)。 (The law investigates negligent acts.)

**Usage Notes**:  
- 过失 (guò shī) is formal, often used in legal, business, or written contexts to mean "fault" or "negligence."  
- For daily "mistake/error," use 错误 (cuò wù) instead.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 过 (guò): Imagine "walking past" (movement radical) the "right way"-you "exceed" the boundary, making a mistake.  
- 失 (shī): Think of "losing" (失) your "focus," you make a "fault."
