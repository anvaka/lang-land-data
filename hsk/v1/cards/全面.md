# **全面 (quánmiàn) - comprehensive; all-around**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **全** (quán): "whole, complete." The radical "人" (rén, person) is on top and "王" (wáng, king) is at the bottom, suggesting a king over all, representing "whole."  
- **面** (miàn): "face, side, surface." The radical "宀" (mián, roof) is on top, "囬" (huí, enclosure) is inside/bottom, referring to a surface or side being covered.

**Examples**:  
- 我们需要全面(quánmiàn)了解这个问题。(Wǒmen xūyào quánmiàn liǎojiě zhège wèntí.) - We need to fully understand this problem.

**Usage Notes**:  
- Used as an adjective before nouns: 全面(quánmiàn)发展 (comprehensive development).  
- Implies covering all aspects, not missing parts.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a king (王, wáng) overseeing everything under the roof (宀, mián): everything is covered - it's "comprehensive."
