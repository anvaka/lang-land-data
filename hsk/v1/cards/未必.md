# **未必 (wèibì) - not necessarily; may not**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 未 (wèi): "not yet." Top: horizontal strokes, looks like a small tree (similar to 木 (mù)), with extra strokes on top-suggesting incompletion.  
- 必 (bì): "certainly, must." Top: 八 (bā, "eight") radical; bottom: small abstract shape, originally depicting a hand holding something, implying inevitability.

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 未必 (wèibì) 同意 (tóngyì)。 (tā wèibì tóngyì) - He may not agree.  
- 这个 (zhège) 方法 (fāngfǎ) 未必 (wèibì) 有效 (yǒuxiào)。 (zhège fāngfǎ wèibì yǒuxiào) - This method is not necessarily effective.  
- 便宜 (piányí) 未必 (wèibì) 好 (hǎo)。 (piányí wèibì hǎo) - Cheap does not necessarily mean good.

**Usage Notes**:  
未必 (wèibì) is usually placed before a verb or adjective, expressing doubt or denial of certainty. Used in written and spoken Chinese, often to soften opinions.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "未 (wèi, not yet) 必 (bì, must)" = "not a must" → not necessarily!
