# **阴 (yīn) - shade; cloudy; negative (in yin-yang)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 阴 (yīn):
  - Left: 阝 (fù) - "mound" radical, often related to land.
  - Right: 侌 (yīn) - represents "hidden" or "covered".
  - Together: suggests the idea of an area blocked from sunlight.

**Examples**:  
- 今天是阴天。(Jīntiān shì yīn tiān.) - Today is a cloudy day.  
- 阴影下很凉快。(Yīnyǐng xià hěn liángkuai.) - It's cool in the shade.  
- 他性格有点阴。(Tā xìnggé yǒudiǎn yīn.) - He has a somewhat reserved/dark personality.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 阴 (yīn) is used for weather (cloudy), shaded places, and as the "negative" half in 阴阳 (yīnyáng).  
- As a weather term, it's the opposite of 晴 (qíng, clear).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think of 阝 (fù) as a hill and 侌 (yīn) as covering it - the shady side of a hill is 阴 (yīn), away from the sun.
