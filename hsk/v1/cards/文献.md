# **文献 (wénxiàn) - Literature, references, documents**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **文** (wén): “script, writing, culture”. Consists of “亠” (tóu, the top "lid") and “乂” (yì, crossed strokes below), representing patterns or script.  
- **献** (xiàn): “to offer, present; contribution”. Left: “南” (nán, south) as the main component, right: “犬” (quǎn, dog), suggesting a formal offering, historically “offering a dog” as tribute.

**Examples**:  
- 我在查找相关文献。(Wǒ zài cházhǎo xiāngguān wénxiàn.) - I am searching for related literature.  
- 这篇文章引用了很多文献。(Zhè piān wénzhāng yǐnyòng le hěn duō wénxiàn.) - This article cites many references.  
- 图书馆有丰富的文献资料。(Túshūguǎn yǒu fēngfù de wénxiàn zīliào.) - The library has abundant documentary resources.

**Usage Notes**:  
“文献” (wénxiàn) is formal, used for academic, historical, or research references. Often plural in meaning. Not used for fictional works.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think “文” (wén, writing) + “献” (xiàn, to offer) = “writing offered (to the world)”, i.e., scholarly documents.
