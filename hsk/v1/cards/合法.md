# **合法 (hé fǎ) - legal; legitimate**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 合 (hé): Means "to fit" or "to combine." Top: "⺁" (cliff); center: "口" (mouth); bottom: "一" (one). Together it once signified two mouths coming together, hence "to join," "fit," or "unite."  
- 法 (fǎ): Means "law," "method." Left: "氵" (three-water drops, radical, left side: water/flow); right: "去" (qù, means "to go" or "leave," composed of "厶" (private) under "土" (earth)). Indicates the flow/path (law/rules).

**Examples**:  
- 这是合法 (zhè shì hé fǎ) - This is legal.  
- 合法工作 (hé fǎ gōng zuò) - Legal work/employment.  
- 他有合法身份 (tā yǒu hé fǎ shēn fèn) - He has legal status.

**Usage Notes**:  
合法 (hé fǎ) is used as an adjective describing actions, status, or things that conform to the law. It often modifies nouns like 证件 (zhèng jiàn, documents), 权益 (quán yì, rights), and 身份 (shēn fèn, status).

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine 合 (hé) as two parts coming together in agreement, and 法 (fǎ) as laws "flowing" like water to organize society. 合法 (hé fǎ) means something "fits" the "rules."
