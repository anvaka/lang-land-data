# **死 (sǐ) - to die; death**

**Character Breakdown**:  
死 (sǐ):  
- Left: 歹 (dǎi) - “bad” or “death” radical (left side), often related to death or decay.  
- Right: 匕 (bǐ) - “spoon” or “dagger” component (right side), sometimes linked to tools or actions.

**Examples**:  
- 他死了。(Tā sǐ le.) - He died.  
- 我怕死。(Wǒ pà sǐ.) - I’m afraid of death.  
- 别怕死。(Bié pà sǐ.) - Don’t be afraid of dying.

**Usage Notes**:  
死 (sǐ) is both a verb (“to die”) and a noun (“death”). Used in negative emotions, hyperbolic expressions (like 累死了 (lèi sǐ le) “dead tired”), or literal contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine 歹 (dǎi) as bones on the left (bad/death) and 匕 (bǐ) as a dagger on the right-together, a symbol of fatality. “Sǐ” sounds a bit like “see you,” as in a farewell.
