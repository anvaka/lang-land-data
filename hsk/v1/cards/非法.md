- **非** (fēi): "not," "non-," or "wrong." Composed of two crossing lines stacked vertically; the top and bottom lines mirror each other, suggesting something "not correct."  
- **法** (fǎ): "law," "method." Left: **氵** (shuǐ) "water" radical. Right: **去** (qù) "to go." Suggests law flows like water and reaches everywhere.

**Memory Aids**:
