# **影子 (yǐng zi) - Shadow**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **影 (yǐng)**: The left side is “景 (jǐng)” (scenery) on top of “彡 (shān)” (hair/lines) representing light or rays at the bottom. Together, it suggests something produced by light-i.e., a shadow.  
- **子 (zi)**: Looks like a child with a large head on top (roof) and small body below. Commonly used as a noun suffix.

**Examples**:  
- 墙上有一个影子。(Qiáng shàng yǒu yí gè yǐng zi.) - There is a shadow on the wall.  
- 我看到自己的影子。(Wǒ kàn dào zì jǐ de yǐng zi.) - I saw my own shadow.  
- 月亮下影子很长。(Yuè liàng xià yǐng zi hěn cháng.) - Shadows are long under the moon.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 影子 (yǐng zi) is a noun, often referring to a literal shadow or sometimes used metaphorically for "trace" or "hint."  
- Commonly used with verbs like 看见 (kàn jiàn, to see), 有 (yǒu, to have), or 跟随 (gēn suí, to follow).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a child (子 zǐ) playing in the light, and their form (影 yǐng) appears as a shadow on the ground.
