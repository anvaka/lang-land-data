# **懒 (lǎn) - lazy**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 懒 (lǎn):
  - Left: 心 (xīn, "heart") radical at the bottom - related to feelings or states of mind.
  - Right: 赖 (lài, "to rely on") - conveys meaning of depending or reluctance to act.

**Examples**:  
- 他很懒。(Tā hěn lǎn.) - He is very lazy.  
- 我今天懒得做饭。(Wǒ jīntiān lǎn de zuò fàn.) - I’m too lazy to cook today.  
- 懒猫在睡觉。(Lǎn māo zài shuìjiào.) - The lazy cat is sleeping.

**Usage Notes**:  
懒 (lǎn) is often used to describe people or animals. Can be paired as 懒惰 (lǎn duò) for a stronger meaning. "懒得 (lǎn de)" + verb means "too lazy to..." (e.g., 懒得动 lǎn de dòng - too lazy to move).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: Your "heart" (心 xīn) doesn't "want to rely" (赖 lài) on effort-so you're 懒 (lǎn), or lazy!
