# **斜 (xié) - slant; tilted; diagonal**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 斜 (xié): Left side: 㫃 (jiàn), a component depicting "sunlight" or "brightness," on the left; right side: 余 (yú), on the right, indicating "surplus" or "extra." The overall character suggests something not upright or askew.

**Examples**:  
- 这条线是斜的。(Zhè tiáo xiàn shì xié de.) - This line is slanted.  
- 太阳斜着照进来。(Tàiyáng xié zhe zhào jìn lái.) - The sun shines in at a slant.

**Usage Notes**:  
斜 (xié) describes any object or line that is not perpendicular or parallel, but at an angle. Can be used as adjective or verb.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 余 (yú) leaning to the right under the "sun," making things not upright-hence, "slant" or "tilt."
