# **答辩 (dábiàn) - Defense; to reply to a charge or question**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **答 (dá)**: To answer, reply. Left: 竹 (zhú, bamboo) radical on top indicates writing or document; right: 合 (hé, combine) on bottom means to join together-suggesting a response composed or written down.  
- **辩 (biàn)**: To debate, argue. Left: 言 (yán, speech) radical on left side means related to words or speech; right: 辛 (xīn, bitter) on top of 辛-implies effort in speaking or arguing.

**Examples**:  
- 他在会议上成功答辩。(Tā zài huìyì shàng chénggōng dábiàn.) - He successfully defended himself at the meeting.  
- 论文答辩很重要。(Lùnwén dábiàn hěn zhòngyào.) - The thesis defense is very important.  
- 你准备好答辩了吗？(Nǐ zhǔnbèi hǎo dábiàn le ma?) - Are you ready for the defense?

**Usage Notes**:  
- **答辩 (dábiàn)** is often used in academic settings, especially for thesis/dissertation defense.  
- Also applies to legal or formal settings where someone must respond to questions or accusations.

**Memory Aids**:  
- **答 (dá)**: Imagine writing (竹, zhú, bamboo slips) a reply (合, hé) to a question.  
- **辩 (biàn)**: Lots of "speech" (言, yán) and "bitterness" (辛, xīn) go into a debate-defending your point!
