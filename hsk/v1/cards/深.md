# **深 (shēn) - Deep; profound**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **深 (shēn)**
  - Left: 氵(shuǐ) "water" radical
  - Right: 㥱 (shēn) phonetic component; contains "木 (mù) tree" at the bottom and "冘 (yín)" at the top.

**Examples**:  
- 水很深。(Shuǐ hěn shēn.) - The water is deep.  
- 他有很深的想法。(Tā yǒu hěn shēn de xiǎngfǎ.) - He has profound thoughts.  
- 深夜里很安静。(Shēn yè lǐ hěn ānjìng.) - It's very quiet late at night.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **深 (shēn)** describes physical or abstract depth (e.g., water depth, emotion, relationships). Common in compounds like **深海 (shēnhǎi)** "deep sea", **深情 (shēnqíng)** "deep feeling".

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think of "water (氵shuǐ)" flowing down, going deep "below the surface"; the tree "木 (mù)" sinks deep into the water.
