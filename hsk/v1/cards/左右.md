# **左右 (zuǒ yòu) - around; approximately; left and right**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **左** (zuǒ): "left." The left side (left) radical [工 (gōng) "work" on the bottom, 扌 (shǒu) "hand" on the left].  
- **右** (yòu): "right." 口 (kǒu) "mouth" on the bottom, 又 (yòu) "again/hand" on the right.

**Examples**:  
- 请往左边走。(qǐng wǎng zuǒ biān zǒu) - Please walk to the left side.  
- 大约十个人左右。(dà yuē shí gè rén zuǒ yòu) - Around ten people.  
- 他在我左右。(tā zài wǒ zuǒ yòu) - He’s around me/on my left and right.

**Usage Notes**:  
左右 (zuǒ yòu) often means "about/approximately" when after numbers, or literally “left and right” in spatial contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine 左 (zuǒ) and 右 (yòu) as two hands-one left, one right. Putting them together, you cover both sides: all around-thus, "approximately."
