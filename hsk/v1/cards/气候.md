# **气候 (qìhòu) - Climate**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **气** (qì): Air, gas, breath. Top: "气" (steam rising) represents vapor.  
- **候** (hòu): Time, season; to wait. Left: "亻" (person); Right: "侯" (marquis), anciently related to waiting or seasons.

**Examples**:  
- 这里的气候很温暖。(Zhèlǐ de qìhòu hěn wēnnuǎn.) - The climate here is warm.  
- 气候变化影响农业。(Qìhòu biànhuà yǐngxiǎng nóngyè.) - Climate change affects agriculture.  
- 你适应了这个气候吗？(Nǐ shìyìng le zhège qìhòu ma?) - Have you adapted to this climate?

**Usage Notes**:  
**气候** (qìhòu) is mostly used for general or long-term weather patterns, not daily weather (**天气** (tiānqì)). Used in scientific, geographic, and everyday contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of **气** (qì) as air and **候** (hòu) as waiting for the right "season"-so **气候** (qìhòu) is the "air's season," or climate.
