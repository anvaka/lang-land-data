# **谁 (shéi) - who**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 谁 (shéi): Left side is ⺌ (xiǎo) "small" on top and 讠(yán) "speech" radical on the left; right side is 隹 (zhuī), "short-tailed bird," representing the sound component. The 讠(yán) radical relates to words or questions.

**Examples**:  
- 你是谁？(nǐ shì shéi?) - Who are you?  
- 谁来了？(shéi lái le?) - Who came?  
- 这是谁的书？(zhè shì shéi de shū?) - Whose book is this?

**Usage Notes**:  
- 谁 (shéi) is a question word for asking about people.  
- Can also mean "whose" when used with 的 (de).  
- Sometimes pronounced as shuí (shuí) in formal situations.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a "speech" (讠 yán) about a "bird" (隹 zhuī): Who is chirping (asking questions)?  
- 谁 (shéi) sounds like "shay" - you're asking "Who is Shay?"
