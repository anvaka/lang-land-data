# **背 (bèi) - back; to recite from memory**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **背** (bèi): Top-⺼(ròu, “meat” radical), indicates a body part; Bottom-北 (běi, “north”), phonetic component. The character originally depicted a back.

**Examples**:  
- 我的背 (wǒ de bèi) 很酸。- My back is very sore.  
- 请你背 (bèi) 这首诗 (zhè shǒu shī)。- Please recite this poem from memory.  
- 他背 (tā bèi) 了很多单词 (hěn duō dāncí)。- He memorized many words.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **背** (bèi) as a noun means “back” (the part of the body); as a verb, it means “to recite/memorize” (e.g., 背 (bèi) 课文 (kèwén), to recite a text).

**Memory Aids**:  
- The “meat” radical reminds you it’s a body part; “北” (běi/north) can help you recall the direction of your back (as if turning your back to the north).  
- To “背” (bèi) (recite), you put words “on your back” (in your memory).
