# **了 (le) - indicates completion, change, or new situation**

**Character Breakdown**:  
了 (le) is made up of two strokes:  
- Top: a horizontal stroke (symbolizing a cap or finish)  
- Bottom: a curved stroke (like a small hook, representing closure)

**Examples**:  
- 我吃了。(Wǒ chī le.) - I have eaten.  
- 他走了。(Tā zǒu le.) - He left.  
- 下雨了。(Xià yǔ le.) - It started to rain.

**Usage Notes**:  
了 (le) at the end marks completed actions or changes of state, not used to simply form the past tense.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 了 (le) as a lid "closing" the sentence, signaling that something is finished or changed.
