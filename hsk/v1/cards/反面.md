# **反面 (fǎn miàn) - Reverse side; opposite; the other side**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **反 (fǎn)**: Means "opposite" or "reverse." The radical 又 (yòu, "again") is on the right, and the shape on the left represents turning over or changing direction.  
- **面 (miàn)**: Means "face," "side," or "surface." The top component is 囟 (xìn, "fontanel"), and the bottom is a horizontal stroke, representing a surface or face.

**Examples**:  
- 这张纸的反面 (zhè zhāng zhǐ de fǎn miàn) - The other side of this paper  
- 事情也有反面 (shì qíng yě yǒu fǎn miàn) - Things also have an opposite side  
- 硬币有正面和反面 (yìng bì yǒu zhèng miàn hé fǎn miàn) - A coin has a front and a reverse side

**Usage Notes**:  
反面 (fǎn miàn) is often used literally (the back/reverse side of an object), but can also mean "the negative/opposite aspect" of something. Common with 正面 (zhèng miàn, "front/positive side").

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine 反 (fǎn) as a hand turning something over, and 面 (miàn) as a surface. 反面 (fǎn miàn) is the side you see after flipping it!
