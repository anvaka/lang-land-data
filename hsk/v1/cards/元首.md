# **元首 (yuánshǒu) - Head of state; leader**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **元 (yuán)**: "Origin" or "primary." At the top is 二 (èr, "two"), and below is 儿 (ér, "child"). It often conveys the sense of "beginning" or "foremost."  
- **首 (shǒu)**: "Head" or "first." At the top is a stylized representation of a face, with 自 (zì, "self") in the middle, and below is 目 (mù, "eye"). Together it suggests the "head" as the leading part.

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 是 (shì) 国家 (guójiā) 的 (de) 元首 (yuánshǒu)。 (Tā shì guójiā de yuánshǒu.) - He is the head of the country.  
- 各国 (gèguó) 元首 (yuánshǒu) 齐聚 (qíjù) 峰会 (fēnghuì)。 (Gèguó yuánshǒu qíjù fēnghuì.) - Heads of state from various countries gather at the summit.  
- 新 (xīn) 元首 (yuánshǒu) 将 (jiāng) 就职 (jiùzhí) 明天 (míngtiān)。 (Xīn yuánshǒu jiāng jiùzhí míngtiān.) - The new head of state will take office tomorrow.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **元首 (yuánshǒu)** is formal and mainly used for top national leaders, similar to "head of state."  
- Not for business or informal leaders; use **领导 (lǐngdǎo)** for those.

**Memory Aids**:  
- **元 (yuán)** sounds like "yuan," the currency, which is fundamental-think of the "chief" or "origin."  
- **首 (shǒu)** is the "head"-remember: the person at the "head" (首/shǒu) is the "origin" (元/yuán) of leadership.
