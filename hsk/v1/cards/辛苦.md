# **辛苦 (xīn kǔ) - Hard-working, laborious; thank you for your hard work**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **辛** (xīn): means "bitter" or "hard." The top shows the "十" (shí) radical (meaning "ten" or "cross"), often associated with hardship; "辛" as a whole represents "spice," metaphorically bitterness.  
- **苦** (kǔ): means "bitter" or "pain." At the top is "艹" (cǎo, "grass") radical, which often relates to plants; below is "古" (gǔ, "old"), possibly reflecting the ancient taste of bitterness.

**Examples**:  
- 工作(工作 gōngzuò)很(很 hěn)辛苦(辛苦 xīnkǔ)。(gōngzuò hěn xīnkǔ.) - The work is very hard.  
- 你(你 nǐ)辛苦(辛苦 xīnkǔ)了(了 le)！(nǐ xīnkǔ le!) - Thank you for your hard work!  
- 农民(农民 nóngmín)生活(生活 shēnghuó)很(很 hěn)辛苦(辛苦 xīnkǔ)。(nóngmín shēnghuó hěn xīnkǔ.) - Farmers' lives are tough.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **辛苦** (xīnkǔ) can describe things that are physically or mentally demanding.  
- Commonly used as a polite phrase: "**辛苦**(辛苦 xīnkǔ)了(了 le)**" (xīnkǔ le) to show thanks after someone finishes a taxing task.

**Memory Aids**:  
- "辛(xīn)" = "Spicy/hard" on top, "苦(kǔ)" = "bitter" under "grass". Imagine working hard ("辛(xīn)") under the sun ("grass" 艹(cǎo)) makes you taste "苦(kǔ)" (bitterness).
