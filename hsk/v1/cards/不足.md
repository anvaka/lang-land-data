# **不足 (bùzú) - insufficient; not enough**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 不 (bù): "not," an ideogram depicting a bird in flight, now means negation.  
- 足 (zú): "foot" or "enough." Pictograph of a foot (bottom) under a stop (top).

**Examples**:  
- 时间不足 (shíjiān bùzú) - Not enough time  
- 水资源不足 (shuǐ zīyuán bùzú) - Insufficient water resources  
- 经验不足 (jīngyàn bùzú) - Lack of experience

**Usage Notes**:  
- 不足 (bùzú) is often used before nouns to indicate shortage. In formal contexts, it can also mean "less than" (e.g., 不足三人 (bùzú sān rén) - fewer than three people).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think "not" (不, bù) plus "enough" (足, zú): When something is “not foot-ed,” it doesn’t measure up-hence, "not enough."
