# **脂肪 (zhī fáng) - fat (noun), body fat**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **脂 (zhī)**: "fat, grease." Left: 月 (yuè) "flesh" radical; right: 旨 (zhǐ) "purpose," phonetic.  
- **肪 (fáng)**: "fat." Left: 月 (yuè) "flesh" radical; right: 方 (fāng) "square," phonetic.

**Examples**:  
- 食物中含有很多脂肪。(shí wù zhōng hán yǒu hěn duō zhī fáng) - The food contains a lot of fat.  
- 他在努力减少体内的脂肪。(tā zài nǔ lì jiǎn shǎo tǐ nèi de zhī fáng) - He is trying to reduce body fat.  
- 植物脂肪对健康有益。(zhí wù zhī fáng duì jiàn kāng yǒu yì) - Plant fats are beneficial to health.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 脂肪 (zhī fáng) refers to fat in food or the body. For "oil" or "fat" in cooking, 油脂 (yóu zhī) may also be used. Used as a noun only, never as a verb.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Both characters have 月 (yuè, flesh) on the left, hinting at something related to the body. 肪 (fáng) sounds a bit like "fat," and 脂 (zhī) resembles "grease."
