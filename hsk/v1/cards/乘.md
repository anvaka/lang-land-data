# **乘 (chéng) - to ride; to multiply; by (transport)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 乘 (chéng): Top - 禾 (hé, "grain" radical), symbolizes crops or grain.
  Bottom - 北 (běi, "north"), but here it functions as a phonetic component, not as its meaning.

**Examples**:  
- 我每天乘(chéng)公交车上班。(Wǒ měitiān chéng gōngjiāochē shàngbān.) - I take the bus to work every day.  
- 请乘(chéng)电梯上楼。(Qǐng chéng diàntī shàng lóu.) - Please take the elevator upstairs.  
- 三乘(chéng)四等于十二。(Sān chéng sì děngyú shí'èr.) - Three times four equals twelve.

**Usage Notes**:  
乘(chéng) is used for "to ride" vehicles (bus, train, elevator), and in math for "to multiply." As a verb in formal or written Chinese.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine harvesting (禾, hé) and carrying grain north (北, běi) by riding a cart-so 乘(chéng) is "to ride." Also, "乘法 (chéngfǎ)" = multiplication.
