# **省 (shěng / xǐng) - to save; province; to examine/reflex**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 省 (shěng/xǐng):
  - Radical: 目 (mù) "eye" on the bottom, means "to see/observe."
  - Upper: 少 (shǎo) "few" on top, often suggests reduction.
  - Whole meaning evolved from "to observe carefully" → "to examine" or "to save/reduce."

- 反省自己的错误。(Fǎnxǐng zìjǐ de cuòwù.) - Reflect on one’s mistakes.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 省 (shěng): verb for "to save," noun for administrative "province."  
- 省 (xǐng): verb for "to reflect/inspect," often in compound words (反省 fǎnxǐng, self-reflection).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Saving (省 shěng) money? Keep a "sharp eye" (目 mù) and use "few" (少 shǎo) resources.  
- Province (省 shěng): Each province is "reduced" (少 shǎo) from the whole country.  
- Reflect (省 xǐng): Use your "eye" (目 mù) to look closely inside yourself.
