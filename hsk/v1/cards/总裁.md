# **总裁 (zǒngcái) - CEO; President (of a company)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **总 (zǒng)**: top = "糸 (mì)" (silk), bottom = "公 (gōng)" (public). Means "general; overall." The idea is to "thread everything together" for a summary or general responsibility.  
- **裁 (cái)**: left = "衣 (yī)" (clothing radical), right = "才 (cái)" (talent). Originally refers to "cut (cloth)" → decide, judge, manage.

- 她成为了最年轻的总裁。(Tā chéngwéile zuì niánqīng de zǒngcái.) - She became the youngest CEO.

**Usage Notes**:  
总裁 (zǒngcái) is a formal business title, commonly used for the highest executive officer in large businesses-equivalent to CEO or company president. Usually not used for leaders of small businesses.

**Memory Aids**:  
总 (zǒng) = summarizes or organizes everything;
