# **总共 (zǒng gòng) - altogether; in total**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 总 (zǒng): "overall; total." The radical is 糸 (mì, silk) on the bottom, and 公 (gōng, public) on top.  
- 共 (gòng): "together; in all." Has 廿 (niàn, twenty) on the top and 八 (bā, eight) on the bottom.

**Usage Notes**:  
总共(zǒng gòng) usually comes before numbers or quantities, emphasizing the total amount. Common in spoken and written Chinese.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 总(zǒng, "total") + 共(gòng, "together") = "Adding everything together gives the total."  
Or: 总(zǒng)-like "sum up", 共(gòng)-like "common/shared" → What is shared by all = the total.
