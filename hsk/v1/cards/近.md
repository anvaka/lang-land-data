# **近 (jìn) - near/close**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 近 (jìn): Left = 辶(chuò) "movement" radical; right = 斤(jīn) "axe." The radical suggests movement or walking, and the overall character historically implies "approaching."

**Examples**:  
- 他家很近。(Tā jiā hěn jìn.) - His home is very close.  
- 请走近一点。(Qǐng zǒu jìn yīdiǎn.) - Please walk a bit closer.  
- 最近很忙。(Zuìjìn hěn máng.) - Recently very busy.

**Usage Notes**:  
近 (jìn) is often used for physical or abstract nearness: time, distance, relationships. Can be used as an adjective or adverb.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine walking (辶 [chuò]) with an axe (斤 [jīn])-a short distance, you must be "near"!
