# **回报 (huí bào) - to repay; return (usually metaphorical, not physical)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **回** (huí): to return.
  Structure: Large "mouth" radical (口 kǒu) enclosing the character for "mouth" (口 kǒu) inside - depicts returning to a place.  
- **报** (bào): to report; to repay.
  Structure: Left: "hand" radical (扌 shǒu, meaning action); Right: "fortune" (幸 xìng) on top, with "wrap" (丨 gǔn) on bottom - to actively deliver news or repayment.
