# **公寓 (gōngyù) - Apartment**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **公 (gōng)**: "public, common." The left part is 八 (bā, "eight") on top, the right is 厶 (sī, "private" or "self") inside.  
- **寓 (yù)**: "residence, to reside." Top is 宀 (mián, "roof") indicating a house; below is 谷 (gǔ, "valley") inside.

**Examples**:  
- 我住在公寓。(Wǒ zhù zài gōngyù.) - I live in an apartment.  
- 这个公寓很大。(Zhège gōngyù hěn dà.) - This apartment is very big.  
- 你想租公寓吗？(Nǐ xiǎng zū gōngyù ma?) - Do you want to rent an apartment?

**Usage Notes**:  
公寓 (gōngyù) is often used for modern apartment buildings or flats, not for single-family homes. Usually refers to multi-story residences.

**Memory Aids**:  
公 (gōng) = "public" + 寓 (yù) = "residence" → "public residence" = apartment. Imagine many people under one roof (宀/mián), sharing a public space!
