# **已经 (yǐ jīng) - already**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **已** (yǐ): Means “already.” The radical is 己 (jǐ), with a “top” horizontal stroke and a “bottom” curved loop, resembling a winding path-indicating something has progressed.  
- **经** (jīng): Means “to pass through” or “undergo.” On the “left” is 纟(sī), the silk radical, suggesting lines or threads; on the “right” is 圣 (shèng), stylized as a script component indicating action.

**Examples**:  
- 我已经吃了。(wǒ yǐ jīng chī le.) - I have already eaten.  
- 天已经黑了。(tiān yǐ jīng hēi le.) - It’s already dark.  
- 他已经走了。(tā yǐ jīng zǒu le.) - He has already left.

**Usage Notes**:  
已经 (yǐ jīng) goes before a verb to indicate the action is completed or the state is achieved; often paired with 了 (le) for emphasis.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: “已” (yǐ), like a winding path, means something's done; “经” (jīng), threads passing through, signals an event has already passed through time.
