# **答应 (dāying) - to agree; to promise**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **答** (dā): Top = ⺮ (bamboo radical), bottom = 合 (hé, "to join/close"). Originally related to writing answers on bamboo slips.  
- **应** (yìng): Left = 广 (guǎng, "shelter"), right = ⼜ (yòu, "again/hand"), suggesting response or compliance.

**Examples**:  
- 他(tā)答应(dāying)帮忙(bāngmáng)。 (Tā dāying bāngmáng.) - He agreed to help.  
- 请(qǐng)你(nǐ)答应(dāying)我(wǒ)。 (Qǐng nǐ dāying wǒ.) - Please promise me.  
- 妈妈(māmā)答应(dāying)带(dài)我(wǒ)去(qù)游乐园(yóulèyuán)。 (Māmā dāying dài wǒ qù yóulèyuán.) - Mom promised to take me to the amusement park.

**Usage Notes**:  
**答应** (dāying) can mean "to agree" (to a request/invitation) or "to promise" (to do something). Used for spoken or informal written language.

**Memory Aids**:  
**答** (dā) looks like bamboo slips used to write answers; **应** (yìng) under a "roof" someone "responds" (hand). Together: "Answer/Promise under a request."
