丰满 (fēngmǎn) can describe physical plumpness (bodies, faces, lips) and figurative richness (content, ideas). Often positive, but context matters; avoid using for negative body comments.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: 丰 (fēng, abundant) + 满 (mǎn, full) = something not lacking, but rounded and complete-full of abundance!
