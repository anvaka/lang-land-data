**Character Breakdown**:  
- **歧 (qí)**: Means "diverge" or "branch." Left side is "止 (zhǐ)" (stop, as a foot radical), right side is "支 (zhī)" (branch/support); together indicating branching off in different directions.  
- **视 (shì)**: Means "to look at" or "regard." Left is "礻 (shì)" (spirit/altar radical), right is "见 (jiàn)" (see) on the right.

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 遭受 (zāoshòu) 歧视 (qíshì)。 (Tā zāoshòu qíshì.) - He suffers discrimination.  
- 我们 (wǒmen) 反对 (fǎnduì) 种族 (zhǒngzú) 歧视 (qíshì)。 (Wǒmen fǎnduì zhǒngzú qíshì.) - We oppose racial discrimination.  
- 歧视 (qíshì) 女性 (nǚxìng) 是 (shì) 不对 (bùduì) 的 (de)。 (Qíshì nǚxìng shì bùduì de.) - Discriminating against women is wrong.

**Usage Notes**:  
歧视 (qíshì) is a verb or noun, often used with groups or objects (e.g., 性别歧视 (xìngbié qíshì) - gender discrimination). Usually negative.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 歧 (qí) as "forking paths" (treating people differently), and 视 (shì) as "the way you look at" others-thus, "unequal regard."
