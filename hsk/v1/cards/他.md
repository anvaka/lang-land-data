# **他 (tā) - he; him**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 他 (tā): Left side is 亻(rén) “person” radical; right side is 也(yě) “also.” Together: “another person” (thus “he”).

**Examples**:  
- 他是老师。(tā shì lǎoshī) - He is a teacher.  
- 我喜欢他。(wǒ xǐhuan tā) - I like him.  
- 他在家。(tā zài jiā) - He is at home.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 他 (tā) is masculine (“he” or “him”).  
- For “she/her” use 她(tā); context usually makes gender clear.  
- Pronouns never change form (no case distinction in Chinese).

**Memory Aids**:  
- 亻(rén) = person; 也(yě) can look like a sitting man. “Person (亻) + also (也)-he is also a person.”
