**Character Breakdown**:  
- **塔** (tǎ): Composed of three parts:
  - Radical **土** (tǔ, "earth") on the left (left side) - indicates relation to earth/structures.
  - **荅** (dá, "reply") on the right (right side); top: **艹** (cǎo, "grass"), middle: **合** (hé, "combine"), bottom: 口 (kǒu, "mouth"). Here, serves as phonetic component.

**Examples**:
