# **简历 (jiǎn lì) - Resume/CV**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 简 (jiǎn): "Simple," "brief." Left: ⺮ (zhú) radical "bamboo" on top, suggesting something written; right: 间 (jiān), refers here to "brief."  
- 历 (lì): "History," "experience." Left: 厂 (hàn) radical "cliff" on top-left; right: 力 (lì) "strength" on the bottom-right.

**Examples**:  
- 请提供一份简历。(qǐng tígōng yí fèn jiǎn lì.) - Please provide a resume.  
- 他的简历很优秀。(tā de jiǎn lì hěn yōu xiù.) - His resume is excellent.  
- 我在更新我的简历。(wǒ zài gēngxīn wǒ de jiǎn lì.) - I am updating my resume.

**Usage Notes**:  
简历 (jiǎn lì) is used in job applications, school admissions, or scholarship submissions-any context requiring a summary of experience/skills.

**Memory Aids**:  
简 (jiǎn) looks like "bamboo slips" (old writing medium), representing brevity; 历 (lì) relates to "history," so 简历 (jiǎn lì) is a "brief history" of you.
