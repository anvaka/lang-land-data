# **洗手间 (xǐ shǒu jiān) - Restroom / Bathroom**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 洗 (xǐ): "to wash"; left = 氵(shuǐ, water radical), right = 先(xiān, phonetic component).  
- 手 (shǒu): "hand"; looks like a hand with fingers.  
- 间 (jiān): "room/space"; left = 门(mén, door radical), right = 日(rì, sun), suggesting a sun inside a door = space/room.

**Examples**:  
- 洗手间在哪里？(xǐ shǒu jiān zài nǎ lǐ?) - Where is the restroom?  
- 请问，我可以用洗手间吗？(qǐng wèn, wǒ kě yǐ yòng xǐ shǒu jiān ma?) - Excuse me, may I use the bathroom?  
- 洗手间在右边。(xǐ shǒu jiān zài yòu biān.) - The restroom is on the right.

**Usage Notes**:  
洗手间(xǐ shǒu jiān) is polite and common in China for public or private restrooms. 厕所(cè suǒ) is more direct but less formal.

**Memory Aids**:  
"洗手(xǐ shǒu)" = wash hands, "间(jiān)" = room: easy to remember as "room for washing hands."
