# **窝 (wō) - Nest; Den; Lair**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **窝 (wō)**: Top is "宀 (mián)" - roof radical, indicating shelter;
  Middle is "冏 (jiǒng)" - ancient pictograph meaning bright or window;
  Bottom is "鸟 (niǎo)" - bird.
  Together: a shelter where a bird lives - a nest.

**Examples**:  
- 鸟窝 (niǎo wō) - bird's nest  
- 他在家里有个小窝。 (tā zài jiā lǐ yǒu gè xiǎo wō) - He has a little home (nest) at home.  
- 老鼠窝 (lǎo shǔ wō) - rat's nest (can mean an actual nest or a den of bad guys)

**Usage Notes**:  
窝 (wō) is both literal (animals' nests) and figurative (a cozy or secret place; sometimes with negative meaning, e.g., a criminal den).

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine a roof (宀 mián) protecting a window (冏 jiǒng) where a bird (鸟 niǎo) stays-like a safe, cozy nest.
