# **卡通 (kǎ tōng) - Cartoon**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 卡 (kǎ): Means "card" or "to block." Top: "上 (shàng)" meaning "up"; bottom: "卜 (bo)" meaning "divination/prophecy."  
- 通 (tōng): Means "to go through," "pass." Left: "辶 (chuò)" walking movement radical; right: "甬 (yǒng)" meaning "a path" or "passage."

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢看卡通。(Wǒ xǐhuān kàn kǎtōng.) - I like watching cartoons.

**Usage Notes**:  
卡通 (kǎtōng) is a borrowed word from "cartoon," mainly used for animated shows or comic-style drawings, especially for children.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think "卡 (kǎ) card" + "通 (tōng) pass/go through" = a card passes through, just like how animation frames "pass through" to make movement, creating a cartoon!
