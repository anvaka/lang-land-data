# **闭塞 (bì sè) - Blocked / Isolated / Obstructed**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **闭 (bì)**: Left: 门 (mén, "door" radical). Right: 扫 (sǎo) minus 土 (tǔ), meaning "close" or "shut."  
- **塞 (sè)**: Top: 宀 (mián, "roof"). Middle: 土 (tǔ, "earth"). Bottom: 口 (kǒu, "mouth"). Combined means "plug," "stop up," or "block."

**Examples**:  
- 这个地方交通闭塞。(Zhè ge dìfang jiāotōng bìsè.) - This place has poor (blocked) transportation.  
- 山区信息闭塞。(Shānqū xìnxī bìsè.) - Information is restricted (blocked) in the mountain areas.  
- 通道被完全闭塞了。(Tōngdào bèi wánquán bìsè le.) - The passage is completely blocked.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **闭塞 (bìsè)** describes something physically or metaphorically blocked or isolated (e.g., traffic, information, regions).  
- Formal; often used in writing or reports.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a 门 (mén, door) "closed" and "塞 (sè, plugged)" with earth-nothing can pass, so it's "blocked" (闭塞 bìsè)!
