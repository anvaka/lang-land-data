# **口气 (kǒu qì) - Tone of voice; manner of speaking**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 口 (kǒu): "Mouth." The radical 口(kǒu) forms the entire character, representing the mouth, speech, or an opening.  
- 气 (qì): "Air; breath." The character resembles air rising. 气(qì) is often associated with breath, vapor, spirit, or energy.

**Examples**:  
- 他说话的口气(kǒu qì)很生气。(Tā shuōhuà de kǒu qì hěn shēngqì.) - His tone of voice was very angry.  
- 请改变你的口气(kǒu qì)。(Qǐng gǎibiàn nǐ de kǒu qì.) - Please change your tone.  
- 你的口气(kǒu qì)太强硬了。(Nǐ de kǒu qì tài qiángyìng le.) - Your manner of speaking is too harsh.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 口气(kǒu qì) describes the emotional tone in speaking, not actual "breath."  
- Common with adjectives to show attitude: 温和(wēnhé)口气(kǒu qì) (gentle manner); 不耐烦(bù nàifán)口气(kǒu qì) (impatient tone).  
- Used in both positive and negative contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 口(kǒu) = mouth and 气(qì) = air/breath ⇒ "the air that comes out of your mouth" = your manner or tone of speaking.
