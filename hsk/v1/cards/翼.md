# **翼 (yì) - wing**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **翼 (yì)**: Means "wing." The character is pictographic, representing the shape of wings. The upper parts depict feather-like strokes spreading out (top: 羽 yǔ “feather”); the lower part (bottom: 異 yì) suggests difference or extraordinary, indicating something extending outward.

**Examples**:  
- 鸟张开双翼。(Niǎo zhāngkāi shuāng yì.) - The bird spreads its wings.  
- 飞机的翼很大。(Fēijī de yì hěn dà.) - The airplane’s wings are very large.  
- 他在左翼工作。(Tā zài zuǒ yì gōngzuò.) - He works in the left wing (organization/party).

**Usage Notes**:  
- **翼 (yì)** literally means "wing" (of birds, airplanes), but also appears in abstract uses (e.g., 左翼 zuǒ yì "left wing" in politics).  
- Often paired as 双翼 (shuāng yì) “a pair of wings”.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine the **羽 (yǔ)** "feathers" on top, supporting the "unique" (異 yì) structure at the bottom-visualize a bird with distinctive, elaborate wings.
