# **继承 (jìchéng) - to inherit; to carry on**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 继 (jì): Left = 纟(sī, "silk" radical) suggests relationship to threads/connection. Right = 既(jì), indicating "already." Together: "continue" like silk threads.  
- 承 (chéng): Top = 扌(shǒu, "hand" component), Bottom = 元(yuán, "origin" or "beginning"). Suggests "receiving" from the origin-thus "to bear," "to inherit."

**Examples**:  
- 他继承了家里的生意。(Tā jìchéng le jiālǐ de shēngyì.) - He inherited the family business.  
- 文化需要一代代地继承。(Wénhuà xūyào yí dài dài de jìchéng.) - Culture needs to be passed down from generation to generation.  
- 她想继承母亲的传统。(Tā xiǎng jìchéng mǔqīn de chuántǒng.) - She wants to inherit her mother's traditions.

**Usage Notes**:  
继承 (jìchéng) is a verb; often used with abstract things (tradition, culture) or concrete (property, business). Typically, the object is what is inherited.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 继 (jì) as "threads continuing" (inheritance connects generations like silk threads), and 承 (chéng) as "hands receiving" something; so 继承 (jìchéng) = threads continue and hands receive = inherit.
