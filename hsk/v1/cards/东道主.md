# **东道主 (dōng dào zhǔ) - Host (of an event)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **东** (dōng) - "east." Composed of 木 (mù, wood) on the bottom and 一 (yī, one) on top; it originally represented the sun rising in the east.  
- **道** (dào) - "way; road." Left: 辶 (chuò, walk/movement radical); right: 首 (shǒu, head/top), suggesting walking on a path.  
- **主** (zhǔ) - "master; host." Top: 丶 (zhǔ, dot); bottom: 王 (wáng, king), indicating someone in charge.

**Examples**:

**Usage Notes**:  
东道主 (dōng dào zhǔ) is often used for the official host of important events, like international summits or sports competitions. It's more formal than simply 主人 (zhǔ rén, host).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of the "east way master" (东 (dōng) 道 (dào) 主 (zhǔ)) as the one leading guests on the “path” to their event - the official host.
