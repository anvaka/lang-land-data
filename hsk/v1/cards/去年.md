# **去年 (qùnián) - last year**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 去 (qù): "to go". Left: 土 (tǔ, earth/radical for place) at the bottom; top: 厶 (sī, private). Suggests "to leave/leave a place".  
- 年 (nián): "year". Top: 秊 (nián, grain/harvest); bottom: 一 (yī, one). Symbolizes cycles/time.

**Examples**:  
- 我去年去了中国。(Wǒ qùnián qùle Zhōngguó.) - I went to China last year.  
- 去年冬天很冷。(Qùnián dōngtiān hěn lěng.) - Last winter was very cold.

**Usage Notes**:  
去年 (qùnián) refers only to the previous calendar year. Used before a verb or time phrase.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine 去 (qù) means "go"-so "go" + "year" (年, nián) = the year that has already "gone" by: last year.
