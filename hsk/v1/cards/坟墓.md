# **坟墓 (fén mù) - Tomb; Grave**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **坟** (fén): "Grave, mound." Left: 土 (tǔ, "earth" radical); right: "文" (wén, "writing")-suggesting a marked or notable place on the earth.  
- **墓** (mù): "Tomb." Top: 艹 (cǎo, "grass" radical); middle: 日 (rì, "sun") and 下 (xià, "under")-together, a place beneath grass exposed to the sun.

**Examples**:  
- 他去了祖先的坟墓。(Tā qùle zǔxiān de fén mù.) - He went to his ancestors' grave.  
- 墓地里很安静。(Mù dì lǐ hěn ān jìng.) - It is very quiet in the cemetery.  
- 我们扫了外公的坟墓。(Wǒmen sǎo le wàigōng de fén mù.) - We swept grandpa’s grave.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 坟墓 (fén mù) is often used in formal or respectful contexts.  
- 坟 (fén) alone means a grave mound; 墓 (mù) can refer to a larger or grander tomb.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 坟 (fén): 土 (tǔ, "earth") + 文 (wén, "writing")-think of the earth marked with writing, like a gravestone.  
- 墓 (mù): Grass (艹 cǎo) on top, sun (日 rì) shining above what is "under" (下 xià)-a resting place under grass and sun.
