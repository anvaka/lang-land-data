# **搭 (dā) - to take (transport), to build, to put up**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 搭 (dā): Left side is 扌 (shǒu, "hand" radical) indicating relation to actions with the hand; right side is 合 (hé, "to combine/to fit") giving pronunciation and idea of joining.

**Examples**:  
- 我每天搭(dā)公交车上班。(Wǒ měitiān dā gōngjiāochē shàngbān.) - I take the bus to work every day.  
- 他们在搭(dā)帐篷。(Tāmen zài dā zhàngpéng.) - They are putting up a tent.  
- 请你搭(dā)一下我的肩膀。(Qǐng nǐ dā yīxià wǒ de jiānbǎng.) - Please put your hand on my shoulder.

**Usage Notes**:  
搭(dā) often pairs with transport words (e.g., 搭(dā)飞机(fēijī), 搭(dā)车(chē)) for "take/ride." Also means "to put up/construct" (e.g., 搭(dā)舞台(wǔtái) - set up a stage).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of using your "hand" (扌(shǒu)) to "combine" (合(hé)) things-either to build or to join others and ride together.
