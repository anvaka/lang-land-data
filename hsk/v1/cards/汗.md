# **汗 (hàn) - Sweat**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **汗** (hàn): Left side is the "water" radical **氵** (shuǐ) indicating relation to liquid; right side is **干** (gān) which means "dry" but here acts as a phonetic component.

**Examples**:  
- 我出了很多汗。(Wǒ chū le hěn duō hàn.) - I sweated a lot.  
- 运动后会流汗。(Yùndòng hòu huì liú hàn.) - You sweat after exercising.  
- 他额头上有汗。(Tā étóu shàng yǒu hàn.) - There is sweat on his forehead.

**Usage Notes**:  
**汗** (hàn) is a noun; often used after verbs like **流** (liú - flow), **出** (chū - come out), or **冒** (mào - emit).

**Memory Aids**:  
The "water" **氵** (shuǐ) on the left hints at something wet, and **干** (gān) on the right reminds you that sweat gets you wet before you dry off.
