# **疏忽 (shūhū) - Negligence; carelessness**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **疏** (shū):
  - Left: "氵" (shuǐ, water radical)
  - Right: "疏" (shū, original form - tree 木 (mù) top, root 㐬 (lín) bottom)
  - Meaning: Negligent, not close, sparse, to neglect.  
- **忽** (hū):
  - Top: "忄" (xīn, heart radical)
  - Below: "忽" (hū, original form - hook shape 勹 (bāo) enclosing small grain 粍 (mǐ) inside)
  - Meaning: To neglect, to overlook; also "suddenly" in other contexts.

**Examples**:  
- 你( nǐ )不能( bùnéng )疏忽( shūhū )安全( ānquán )。( Nǐ bùnéng shūhū ānquán. ) - You must not neglect safety.  
- 因为( yīnwèi )疏忽( shūhū )，他( tā )丢了( diūle )钱包( qiánbāo )。( Yīnwèi shūhū, tā diūle qiánbāo. ) - He lost his wallet due to carelessness.  
- 她( tā )工作中( gōngzuò zhōng )从不( cóng bù )疏忽( shūhū )细节( xìjié )。( Tā gōngzuò zhōng cóng bù shūhū xìjié. ) - She never neglects details in her work.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 疏忽( shūhū ) is often followed by an object (e.g., 疏忽大意( shūhū dàyì ), 疏忽责任( shūhū zérèn )).  
- Use in formal and written contexts, or when referring to mistakes caused by negligence.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 疏( shū ) looks like water 氵( shuǐ ) flowing away-think of attentiveness "flowing away" (neglect).  
- 忽( hū ) has a heart 忄( xīn ) radical-when the heart is not focused, you’re careless (疏忽( shūhū )).
