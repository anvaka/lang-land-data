# **潇洒 (xiāo sǎ) - Natural and Elegant; Free and Easy**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **潇** (xiāo): Left: 氵 (shuǐ, "water" radical) hints at fluidity. Right: 肖 (xiào), meaning "resemble." The water radical on the left signals a carefree, flowing quality.  
- **洒** (sǎ): Left: 氵 (shuǐ, "water" radical) again. Right: 西 (xī, "west") on the top, 少 (shǎo, "few") at the bottom. Refers to sprinkling or spreading-implying a relaxed manner.

**Examples**:  
- 他(tā)走路(zǒu lù)很(hěn)潇洒(xiāo sǎ)。 (Tā zǒu lù hěn xiāo sǎ.) - He walks with an easy grace.  
- 她(tā)的(de)穿着(chuānzhuó)很(hěn)潇洒(xiāo sǎ)。 (Tā de chuānzhuó hěn xiāo sǎ.) - Her style is very carefree and elegant.  
- 生活(shēnghuó)要(yào)潇洒(xiāo sǎ)一点(yīdiǎn)。 (Shēnghuó yào xiāo sǎ yīdiǎn.) - Life should be a bit more easygoing.

**Usage Notes**:  
潇洒(xiāo sǎ) describes demeanor, appearance, or actions that are natural, unrestrained, and stylish. It is generally positive and often used to praise someone's personality or lifestyle.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine water (氵, shuǐ) flowing freely and gracefully-just like a 潇洒(xiāo sǎ) person moves or lives. Both characters have the water radical, linking to the idea of effortless elegance.
