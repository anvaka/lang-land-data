# **颠簸 (diān bǒ) - Bump; jolt; turbulence**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **颠** (diān): "topple; turn upside down." Left: "頁" (yè, head) radical. Top: "真" (zhēn, true) showing connection to the head/skull. The idea is overturning the head.  
- **簸** (bǒ): "to shake." Top: "⺮" (zhú, bamboo) radical. Inside: "波" (bō, wave), which means to shake like bamboo in waves.

**Examples**:  
- 飞机在气流中颠簸。(Fēijī zài qìliú zhōng diānbǒ.) - The plane is bumpy in turbulence.  
- 巴士在泥路上颠簸。(Bāshì zài nílù shàng diānbǒ.) - The bus bumps along the muddy road.  
- 小船被风浪颠簸得很厉害。(Xiǎochuán bèi fēnglàng diānbǒ de hěn lìhài.) - The boat was badly jolted by the wind and waves.

**Usage Notes**:  
颠簸 (diānbǒ) is mostly used for physical jolts (vehicles, boats, etc.), and less often for figurative use.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine your “head” (颠, diān) on top “shaking” with bamboo (簸, bǒ) every time you hit a bump!
