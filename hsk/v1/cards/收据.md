# **收据 (shōu jù) - Receipt**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **收 (shōu)**: "to receive, to collect." Left is the 丩 (jiū）, to join; right: 收 (shōu)-phonetic.  
- **据 (jù)**: "proof, evidence." Left: 扌 (shǒu)-"hand" radical on the left, for actions or handling; right: 居 (jū)-phonetic component.

**Examples**:  
- 请给我收据。(Qǐng gěi wǒ shōu jù.) - Please give me a receipt.  
- 我丢了收据。(Wǒ diū le shōu jù.) - I lost the receipt.  
- 你有购物收据吗？(Nǐ yǒu gòu wù shōu jù ma?) - Do you have the shopping receipt?

**Usage Notes**:  
收据 (shōu jù) is for everyday purchase receipts. For formal invoices, use 发票 (fā piào).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "Receiving (收 shōu) proof (据 jù)"-a receipt is proof you received something. Both characters use the "hand" radical, associating with exchanging items.
