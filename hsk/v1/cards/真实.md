# **真实 (zhēn shí) - real; true; genuine**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 真 (zhēn): "real; true." The top is 十 (shí, "ten") over 具 (jù, "tool;" here simplified as 目 (mù, "eye")), suggesting "something seen as true."  
- 实 (shí): "real; solid." Top is 宀 (mián, "roof") indicating "house;" bottom is 头 (tóu, "head") (dots and line), representing "substance under a roof," thus "reality" or "substance."

**Examples**:  
- 他说的很真实。(Tā shuō de hěn zhēn shí.) - What he said is very true.  
- 我喜欢真实的朋友。(Wǒ xǐ huān zhēn shí de péng yǒu.) - I like genuine friends.  
- 这部电影很真实。(Zhè bù diàn yǐng hěn zhēn shí.) - This movie is very realistic.

**Usage Notes**:  
真实 (zhēn shí) is often used as an adjective to describe things that are authentic, sincere, or factual. It is commonly paired with nouns or abstract concepts (e.g., 真实情况 zhēn shí qíng kuàng - real situation).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 真 (zhēn) as "truly seeing" (eye + ten: many eyes confirming truth), and 实 (shí) as "something solid under a roof" (real, not empty). Together, they mean “truly real.”
