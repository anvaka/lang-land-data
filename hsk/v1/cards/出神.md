# **出神 (chū shén) - to be lost in thought; entranced**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 出 (chū): "to go out" or "to emerge." Top: 十 (shí, "ten"); bottom: 凵 (kǎn, "open box"), suggesting something coming out of a container.  
- 神 (shén): "spirit," "deity," or "mind." Left: 礻 (shì, related to ritual/spirit); right: 申 (shēn, "to state"), together implying spiritual presence or mind.

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 看得出神 (kàn de chū shén)。 (He watched, lost in thought.)  
- 她 (tā) 听音乐时 (tīng yīn yuè shí) 常常出神 (cháng cháng chū shén)。 (She often gets entranced when listening to music.)  
- 老师 (lǎo shī) 叫他 (jiào tā) 他还在出神 (tā hái zài chū shén)。 (The teacher called him, but he was still lost in thought.)

**Usage Notes**:  
- 出神 (chū shén) describes a mental state-being so absorbed that you lose awareness of your surroundings. Usually used as a verb or complement: 出神地 (chū shén de, "entrancedly"), 看出神 (kàn chū shén, "entranced by watching"), etc.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine your spirit (神 shén) "coming out" (出 chū) as you space out-your mind leaves the room!
