# **生疏 (shēngshū) - Unfamiliar / Out of practice**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 生 (shēng): means "to be born," "raw," or "new". Top: grass radical (⺾ "cǎo"), bottom: "life" component (生 "shēng").  
- 疏 (shū): means "neglect," "疏远" (shūyuǎn - distant), or "out of practice". Left: "sickness" radical (疒 "nè" on left). Right: "separate" component (束 "shù" inside right).

**Examples**:  
- 我对这项工作很生疏。(Wǒ duì zhè xiàng gōngzuò hěn shēngshū.) - I am unfamiliar with this job.  
- 他和老朋友变得有些生疏了。(Tā hé lǎo péngyǒu biàn de yǒuxiē shēngshū le.) - He and his old friend have become a bit distant.  
- 很久没练习，钢琴弹得有点生疏了。(Hěnjiǔ méi liànxí, gāngqín tán de yǒudiǎn shēngshū le.) - I haven't practiced for a long time, so my piano playing is a bit rusty.

**Usage Notes**:  
生疏 (shēngshū) describes lack of familiarity or skill, often from lack of practice. Can apply to people, skills, or relationships.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine being "born" (生 shēng) into a "distant" (疏 shū) place-everything feels unfamiliar (生疏 shēngshū).
