# **隐患 (yǐn huàn) - Hidden danger; potential hazard**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **隐 (yǐn)**:
  - Left: 阝(fù), "mound/city" radical (indicates place/area),
  - Right: 怨 (yuàn), "resentment," conveys hidden or concealed feelings.  
- **患 (huàn)**:
  - Top: 串 (chuàn), "string together,"
  - Bottom: 心 (xīn), "heart,"
  - Together suggest something worrying the heart-a source of trouble.

**Examples**:  
- 这个工厂存在很多隐患。(zhè gè gōng chǎng cún zài hěn duō yǐn huàn.) - There are many hidden dangers in this factory.  
- 我们要排查所有安全隐患。(wǒ men yào pái chá suǒ yǒu ān quán yǐn huàn.) - We must check all safety hazards.  
- 这些隐患很容易被忽视。(zhè xiē yǐn huàn hěn róng yì bèi hū shì.) - These hidden dangers are easily overlooked.

**Usage Notes**:  
隐患 (yǐn huàn) is typically used in safety or risk contexts for dangers not immediately visible; often found in formal, technical, or official language.

**Memory Aids**:  
隐 (yǐn) has 阝(fù) suggesting a place-think "danger hidden in a place." 患 (huàn) with 心 (xīn, heart) below hints the hazard isn’t seen but worries the "heart" deep down.
