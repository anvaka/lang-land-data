# **夹杂 (jiāzá) - to mix; to mingle; to be mixed with**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 夹 (jiā): Means "to press from both sides," "to sandwich," or "to squeeze." The radical 大 (dà, "big") is inside, with two small strokes (丿 left/top, 一 bottom) at the top and bottom, representing a thing squeezed in between.  
- 杂 (zá): Means "mixed," "miscellaneous." On top is the radical 九 (jiǔ, "nine"), and below is 木 (mù, "wood"). The combination suggests various things (like different pieces of wood mixed together).

**Examples**:  
- 这本书夹杂(jiāzá)着很多外来词(wàiláicí)。 (Zhè běn shū jiāzá zhe hěn duō wàiláicí.) - This book contains many foreign words mixed in.  
- 他的声音里夹杂(jiāzá)着哭腔(kūqiāng)。 (Tā de shēngyīn lǐ jiāzá zhe kūqiāng.) - There was a sob in his voice.  
- 雨水里夹杂(jiāzá)着灰尘(huīchén)。 (Yǔshuǐ lǐ jiāzá zhe huīchén.) - The rainwater was mixed with dust.

**Usage Notes**:  
夹杂(jiāzá) is often used with abstract elements (emotions, sounds, influences) or concrete items. It usually appears as 夹杂着(jiāzá zhe) to show something is being mixed in.

**Memory Aids**:  
夹(jiā) looks like something caught in between; 杂(zá) contains 木(mù), as if many woods are mixed. Remember: 夹杂(jiāzá) = things squeezed and mixed together.
