# **趴 (pā) - to lie face down; to bend over; to sprawl**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 趴 (pā): Left is the "foot" radical (⻊/足 zú) indicating movement/action; right is 巴 (bā) which often means "to hope for" or "to cling." Here, together they form the meaning of pressing the body down (as with movement close to the ground).

**Examples**:  
- 他趴(pā)在桌子(zhuōzi)上(shàng)睡觉(shuìjiào)。 (Tā pā zài zhuōzi shàng shuìjiào.) - He is sleeping with his face down on the desk.  
- 小猫(xiǎomāo)趴(pā)在地上(dìshàng)。 (Xiǎomāo pā zài dìshàng.) - The kitten is lying on the ground.  
- 孩子(háizi)趴(pā)着画画(huàhuà)。 (Háizi pā zhe huàhuà.) - The child is drawing while lying on his stomach.

**Usage Notes**:  
- Usually used for body positions, especially animals or people face-down/horizontal.  
- Structure: Subject + 趴(pā) + 在(zài) + place + (verb).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine your "feet" (足 zú) and your "body" (巴 bā) both "clinging" close to the ground-so you are lying flat: 趴(pā)!
