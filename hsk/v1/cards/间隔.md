# **间隔 (jiān gé) - Interval; Gap; Space**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **间 (jiān)**:
  - Left: 门 (mén, "door" radical)
  - Inside: 日 (rì, "sun", representing something inside the doorway)
  - Meaning: "between," "space," "room," originally a "sun seen through a door" (space/gap)  
- **隔 (gé)**:
  - Left: 阝 (fù, "mound/hill" radical, often relates to place/boundary)
  - Right: 骨 (gǔ, "bone")
  - Meaning: "to separate," "to partition"

**Examples**:  
- 我们需要保持间隔。(Wǒmen xūyào bǎochí jiān gé.) - We need to keep a distance/space.  
- 座位之间有间隔。(Zuòwèi zhī jiān yǒu jiān gé.) - There is space between the seats.  
- 间隔多久发一次车？(Jiān gé duōjiǔ fā yí cì chē?) - How long is the interval between buses?

**Usage Notes**:  
- 间隔 (jiān gé) is commonly used for time (intervals between events) and space (gaps or distances).  
- Can be used as a noun or in set phrases (e.g., 时间间隔 (shíjiān jiān gé) - time interval).

**Memory Aids**:  
- 间 (jiān): Imagine a "sun" (日 rì) shining "through the door" (门 mén): there’s space!  
- 隔 (gé): Hills and bones create **separations**-think of a boundary (阝 fù) with "bones" (骨 gǔ) marking the division.
