# **枝 (zhī) - branch, measure word for long, thin objects**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 枝 (zhī): Left side is 木 (mù, "wood" radical, left), right side is 支 (zhī, "to support," right). The character relates to trees and things that branch or extend.

**Examples**:  
- 一枝花 (yī zhī huā) - One flower (single stem)  
- 树上有很多枝。(Shù shàng yǒu hěn duō zhī.) - There are many branches on the tree.  
- 请递给我一枝笔。(Qǐng dì gěi wǒ yī zhī bǐ.) - Please pass me a pen.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 枝 (zhī) is used as a measure word for long, slender objects (like pens, flowers).  
- When referring to a physical part of a tree, 枝 (zhī) means "branch."

**Memory Aids**:  
- The 木 (mù, "wood") radical reminds you of trees, which have branches (枝, zhī).  
- Think: a 支 (zhī, "branch/support") coming out from 木 (mù, "wood") = branch!
