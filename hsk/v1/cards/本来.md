# **本来 (běnlái) - originally; at first; originally supposed to**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 本 (běn): "Root" or "origin." The top is 木 (mù, "tree"), with 一 (yī, "one") at the base, emphasizing "root" or "origin" at the bottom.  
- 来 (lái): "To come." Top is a small stroke (⺗/ 一), center is 木 (mù, "tree"), bottom is a short line, meaning "something coming to the tree," i.e., "to come."

**Examples**:  
- 我本来(běnlái)不知道(zhīdào)这件(zhèjiàn)事(shì)。(Wǒ běnlái bù zhīdào zhè jiàn shì.) - I originally didn't know about this.  
- 天气本来(běnlái)很好(hěnhǎo)。(Tiānqì běnlái hěn hǎo.) - The weather was originally good.  
- 他本来(běnlái)打算(dǎsuàn)来(lái)，但(dàn)临时(línshí)有事(yǒushì)。(Tā běnlái dǎsuàn lái, dàn línshí yǒu shì.) - He originally planned to come, but something came up last minute.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 本来(běnlái) is an adverb. Used to state the original situation before a change. Often paired with 但是(dànshì, "but") or 可是(kěshì, "but").

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think of 本(běn) as a tree's "root" and 来(lái) as "to come," so the "root cause" or "original state" is what was there before things changed.
