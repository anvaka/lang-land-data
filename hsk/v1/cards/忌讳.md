# **忌讳 (jìhuì) - Taboo; to avoid as taboo**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **忌** (jì): Top: "己" (jǐ) means "self"; Bottom: "心" (xīn) means "heart". Together, it relates to things that touch one’s heart too closely - thus, to avoid.  
- **讳** (huì): Left: "讠" (yán) speech radical; Right: "韦" (wéi) sounds like the character. Original sense: to avoid speaking of something.

**Examples**:  
- 在中国，数字“四”(sì)是一个忌讳(jìhuì)。(zài zhōngguó, shùzì “sì” shì yí gè jìhuì.) - In China, the number "4" is a taboo.  
- 有些话在正式场合是忌讳(jìhuì)的。(yǒuxiē huà zài zhèngshì chǎnghé shì jìhuì de.) - Some topics are taboo in formal settings.  
- 他们家对离婚很忌讳(jìhuì)。(tāmen jiā duì líhūn hěn jìhuì.) - Their family finds divorce a taboo.

**Usage Notes**:  
**忌讳** (jìhuì) is usually used for social, cultural, or personal taboos; often appears as a noun or verb. E.g., "很忌讳" (hěn jìhuì) = is taboo, "有什么忌讳？"(yǒu shénme jìhuì?) = Are there any taboos?

**Memory Aids**:  
**忌** (jì): Your "heart" (**心** (xīn)) tells you (**己** (jǐ), yourself) to avoid something.  
**讳** (huì): "Speech" (**讠** (yán)) is avoided about those taboos.
