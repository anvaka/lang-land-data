# **银 (yín) - silver**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **银** (yín): Left = “钅”(jīn, metal radical, indicating relation to metals), right = “艮”(gěn, means "stopping" but here is just for sound). “钅” (jīn) is the left-side radical for metals; “艮” (gěn) is on the right.

**Examples**:  
- 这枚银币很漂亮。(Zhè méi yínbì hěn piàoliang.) - This silver coin is very beautiful.  
- 她喜欢戴银饰。(Tā xǐhuan dài yínshì.) - She likes to wear silver jewelry.  
- 银行在前面。(Yínháng zài qiánmiàn.) - The bank is ahead.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **银** (yín) refers to the metal "silver" but is also seen in words related to money, finance, and color (e.g., 银色 yínsè).  
- Common in compounds: **银行** (yínháng, bank), **银牌** (yínpái, silver medal).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think of the metal radical “钅” (jīn) on the left, hinting it's a type of metal.  
- “银” (yín) sounds a bit like “yin” in Yin and Yang, linking to silver’s association with moon/night/yin in Chinese culture.
