# **员工 (yuángōng) - Employee, staff**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **员 (yuán)**: Means "member" or "personnel." Radical 口 (kǒu, “mouth”) is on the inside; the outside is 贝 (bèi, “shell/money”), hinting at people counted as personnel.  
- **工 (gōng)**: Means "work." Consists of a simple three-stroke character, imitating a carpenter’s square-symbolizing labor or work.

**Examples**:  
- 他是新员工。(Tā shì xīn yuángōng.) - He is a new employee.  
- 公司有五百名员工。(Gōngsī yǒu wǔ bǎi míng yuángōng.) - The company has 500 employees.  
- 员工很努力工作。(Yuángōng hěn nǔlì gōngzuò.) - The employees work very hard.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 员工 (yuángōng) is neutral and formal, referring collectively or individually to staff in an organization.  
- For “colleague,” use 同事 (tóngshì).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think: 员 (yuán) for “member” + 工 (gōng) for “work” = someone who belongs to work-a worker or employee.  
- The mouth (口, kǒu) inside 员 (yuán) reminds you that employees are people (mouths to feed) in a company.
