# **左边 (zuǒ biān) - left side**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 左 (zuǒ): "left." Left side: the radical "扌" (shǒu) means "hand," on the left, and "工" (gōng, "work") on the right. Combines to suggest the "hand you use for work on the left side."  
- 边 (biān): "side." Contains "辶" (chuò, "walk" radical) at the left-bottom, indicating movement or edge, and "力" (lì, "strength") inside/right-top, suggesting boundary/power at an edge.

**Examples**:  
- 请走到左边。(Qǐng zǒu dào zuǒ biān.) - Please walk to the left side.  
- 我的书包在左边。(Wǒ de shūbāo zài zuǒ biān.) - My backpack is on the left side.  
- 他坐在我左边。(Tā zuò zài wǒ zuǒ biān.) - He is sitting on my left side.

**Usage Notes**:  
左边 (zuǒ biān) refers specifically to the "left side" of something. Common for giving directions or describing spatial relations. Often used with 在 (zài, "at/on") to indicate location.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "Left (左 zuǒ) hand at your side (边 biān)." Imagine stretching your left hand out to the side to remember "左边 (zuǒ biān)" is "left side."
