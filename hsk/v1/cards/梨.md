# **梨 (lí) - Pear**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 梨 (lí): Left is 木 (mù, "wood") - suggests a tree or something plant-related. Right is 利 (lì, "sharp/profitable") - here, it phonetically relates to the pronunciation.

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢吃梨。(Wǒ xǐhuān chī lí.) - I like to eat pears.  
- 这只梨很甜。(Zhè zhī lí hěn tián.) - This pear is very sweet.  
- 桌子上有两个梨。(Zhuōzi shàng yǒu liǎng gè lí.) - There are two pears on the table.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 梨 (lí) is a common noun.  
- Shares the same pronunciation as 离 (lí, "to leave"), so sometimes avoided in gifting to couples (as "separation" is inauspicious).

**Memory Aids**:  
- 木 (mù, "wood") on the left: pears grow on trees.  
- Think of "lucky" pears: 利 (lì) brings good luck with this yummy fruit!
