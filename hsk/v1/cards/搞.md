# **搞 (gǎo) - to do; to make; to engage in**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 搞 (gǎo): Left is 扌(shǒu) "hand" radical (left), indicating actions involving the hand. Right is the phonetic 高(gāo) "high" (right).

- Common in spoken Chinese; can mean "cause," "organize," or "mess with" depending on context.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine your "hand" (扌 shǒu) getting involved in “high” (高 gāo) tasks-whenever you're getting something done, you're 搞(gǎo) it!
