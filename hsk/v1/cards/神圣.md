# **神圣 (shén shèng) - Sacred; Holy**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **神** (shén): Means "spirit; deity; god." On the left is the radical 礻(shì) meaning “spirit” or “ritual,” and on the right is 申(shēn) meaning "to state" or "to extend."  
- **圣** (shèng): Means "holy; sacred." The top is 土(tǔ) meaning "earth," the middle is 口(kǒu) meaning "mouth," and the bottom is 王(wáng) meaning "king." It suggests a "holy king" or someone with sacred authority.

**Examples**:  
- 这座寺庙是个神圣的地方。(Zhè zuò sìmiào shì ge shénshèng de dìfāng.) - This temple is a sacred place.

**Memory Aids**:  
- **神** (shén) = Think “spirit” on the left, “statement” on the right-spirits communicate messages.  
- **圣** (shèng) looks like someone on earth (土 tǔ) with a mouth (口 kǒu) and kingly status (王 wáng): a holy king.
