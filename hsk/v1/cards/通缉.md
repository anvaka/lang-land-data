**Character Breakdown**:  
- **通** (tōng): "To go through; to communicate." Left/side is "辶" (chuò) "walk," right is "甬" (yǒng) "passage."  
- **缉** (jī): "To arrest; to seize." Left/side is "纟" (sī) "silk/thread," right is "咠" (qì) "whisper," suggesting secret pursuit.

**Examples**:  
- 警方已经通缉了嫌疑人。(Jǐngfāng (police) yǐjīng (already) tōngjī (put on wanted list) le xiányírén (suspect).) - The police have already put out a wanted notice for the suspect.
