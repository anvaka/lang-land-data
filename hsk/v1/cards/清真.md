# **清真 (qīngzhēn) - Halal / Pure and Truthful**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **清** (qīng): Top: ⺡(shuǐ, "water" radical); right: 青(qīng, "blue/green"). Originally refers to "clear water"-meaning "pure" or "clean."  
- **真** (zhēn): Top: 十(shí, "ten"); middle: 目(mù, "eye"); bottom: 一(yī, "one"). Means "real" or "true."

**Examples**:  
- 这家是清真餐厅。(Zhè jiā shì qīngzhēn cāntīng.) - This is a halal restaurant.  
- 他只吃清真食品。(Tā zhǐ chī qīngzhēn shípǐn.) - He only eats halal food.  
- 你了解清真文化吗？(Nǐ liǎojiě qīngzhēn wénhuà ma?) - Do you understand halal culture?

**Usage Notes**:  
**清真** (qīngzhēn) mainly describes food, restaurants, or anything conforming to Islamic dietary laws. Used as adjective (清真食品 qīngzhēn shípǐn, halal food) or noun (指伊斯兰教 halal/Islamic things).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of **清** (qīng, "pure") as clean water and **真** (zhēn, "truth") as genuine-so **清真** (qīngzhēn) is "pure truth," fitting for something religiously pure like halal!
