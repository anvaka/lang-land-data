# **成天 (chéngtiān) - All day; All the time**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **成** (chéng): Means "to become" or "to accomplish." Radical: 戈 (gē, weapon) at the right, indicating action; phonetic partly from the rest.  
- **天** (tiān): Means "sky" or "day." Radical: 大 (dà, big) at the bottom with a single horizontal stroke (一, yī) on top, suggesting "above a person" (the sky).

**Examples**:  
- 他(tā)成天(chéngtiān)玩手机(wán shǒujī)。 (Tā chéngtiān wán shǒujī.) - He plays on his phone all day.  
- 我(wǒ)不想(bù xiǎng)成天(chéngtiān)加班(jiābān)。 (Wǒ bù xiǎng chéngtiān jiābān.) - I don’t want to work overtime all the time.  
- 成天(chéngtiān)下雨(xià yǔ)，真(zhēn)烦人(fánrén)。 (Chéngtiān xià yǔ, zhēn fánrén.) - It rains all day; it's really annoying.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 成天(chéngtiān) is an informal adverb, placed before verbs to describe continuous action throughout the day. Equivalent to "all day long" or "constantly" in English.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine "成(chéng, become) 天(tiān, the sky)" = become the sky/all day in the sky → spend the whole day doing something.
