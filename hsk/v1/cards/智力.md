# **智力 (zhìlì) - Intelligence; intellect**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **智** (zhì): "Wisdom, intelligence." Left: **知** (zhī, "to know") as the phonetic on the left; right/top: **日** (rì, "sun") above **口** (kǒu, "mouth") forming the semantic, indicating "knowledge expressed."  
- **力** (lì): "Strength, power." Looks like a muscled arm, symbolizing physical or mental force.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **智力** (zhìlì) refers to cognitive/intellectual abilities, not physical strength. Pairs often with words like **发展** (fāzhǎn, "development") or **测验** (cèyàn, "test").

**Memory Aids**:
