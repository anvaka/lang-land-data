# **派别 (pài bié) - Faction; Sect; Group**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **派** (pài): Left side is 氵(three water dots, left), right side is the character 𣏟 (pài), which originally suggested "to send out" or "to divide." The water radical (氵, left) hints at dispensation or separation, like branching streams.  
- **别** (bié): Right side is the 刂(knife radical, right), left side is the character 另 (lìng, right) meaning "other." 刂(knife, right) implies separation; 另(right) implies "different"-together indicate "difference" or "to separate."

**Examples**:  
- 这个组织有很多不同的派别。(Zhè ge zǔzhī yǒu hěn duō bùtóng de pài bié.) - This organization has many different factions.  
- 派别之间常常会有争论。(Pài bié zhījiān chángcháng huì yǒu zhēnglùn.) - There are often arguments between factions.  
- 他属于保守派别。(Tā shǔyú bǎoshǒu pài bié.) - He belongs to a conservative faction.

**Usage Notes**:  
**派别** (pài bié) is used to describe different groups, divisions, or sects within a larger organization, especially in politics, academia, or philosophy. Often appears in formal or written contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine each **派** (pài) "stream" (water radical, left) splits into different **别** (bié) "directions" (knife, right, separates), forming various **派别** (pài bié) "factions."
