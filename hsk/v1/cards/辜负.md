# **辜负 (gū fù) - Let down; fail to live up to**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **辜 (gū)**: Means "crime" or "wrong". The left side is ⻌ (chuò), "walk" radical, and the right side is 古 (gǔ) "ancient".  
- **负 (fù)**: Means "bear" or "carry" (also "to owe" or "to fail"). Top is ⺧ (niú) "cow", bottom is 負 (fù) simplified.

**Examples**:  
- 我不会辜负(gū fù)你的信任。(Wǒ bù huì gū fù nǐ de xìnrèn.) - I won't let down your trust.  
- 他辜负(gū fù)了父母的期望。(Tā gū fù le fùmǔ de qīwàng.) - He failed his parents' expectations.  
- 别辜负(gū fù)这次机会！(Bié gū fù zhè cì jīhuì!) - Don't waste this opportunity!

**Usage Notes**:  
辜负(gū fù) is usually used for letting someone down emotionally, not for breaking rules. Often followed by nouns like 希望(xīwàng) (hope), 信任(xìnrèn) (trust), or 期望(qīwàng) (expectations).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: If you “carry”(负 fù) a “crime”(辜 gū), you disappoint (let down) others. Remember "辜负 expectations" to link meaning!
