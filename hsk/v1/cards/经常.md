# **经常 (jīng cháng) - often / frequently**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 经 (jīng): Left/side-纟(sī) "silk"; right-巠(jīng) suggesting "path, warp". Originally related to weaving threads (frequent action).  
- 常 (cháng): Top-宀(mián) "roof"; middle-尚(shàng) "esteem"; bottom-巾(jīn) "cloth". Implies something happening "regularly or for a long time under a roof".

**Examples**:  
- 我经常锻炼身体。(Wǒ jīng cháng duàn liàn shēn tǐ.) - I often exercise.  
- 他经常迟到。(Tā jīng cháng chí dào.) - He is often late.  
- 你经常去图书馆吗？(Nǐ jīng cháng qù tú shū guǎn ma?) - Do you often go to the library?

**Usage Notes**:  
经常 (jīng cháng) is used before verbs to indicate habitual or frequent actions, similar to "often" or "regularly" in English.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: 经(jīng) = “thread/path” (actions running through your life), 常(cháng) = “regular/constant under a roof”, so 经常(jīng cháng) means things happening on a regular "thread" in your daily life.
