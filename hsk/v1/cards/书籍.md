# **书籍 (shūjí) - Books; Book(s)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 书 (shū): Means "book." The top is the radical ㇇, resembling a cover, and the bottom 曰 (yuē) suggests speech, relating to knowledge.  
- 籍 (jí): Means "register; record." "⺮(zhú)" (bamboo) is on top (represents old writing material); left-bottom "耳 (ěr)" (ear), right-bottom "即 (jí)" (promptly). Together, implies registering or listing information.

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢读书籍。(Wǒ xǐhuan dú shūjí.) - I like reading books.  
- 这些书籍很有价值。(Zhèxiē shūjí hěn yǒu jiàzhí.) - These books are valuable.  
- 图书馆里有很多书籍。(Túshūguǎn lǐ yǒu hěn duō shūjí.) - There are many books in the library.

**Usage Notes**:  
书籍 (shūjí) is formal; use it for "books" as collective works or literature. For a single book, use 书 (shū).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: 书 (shū) = "Book" + 籍 (jí) = "Register" → All recorded books; a "book collection."
