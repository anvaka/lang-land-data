# **不 (bù) - not; no**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 不 (bù): Means "not" or "no". At the top is a horizontal line, beneath is a "丿"(piě, left-falling stroke), and crossing it is "一" (yī, one/horizontal stroke). Radical: 一 (yī, one) at the very top. The shape suggests a bird flying upward (historical form), symbolizing rejection or negation.

**Examples**:  
- 我不喜欢 (wǒ bù xǐ huān) - I don't like [it].  
- 他不是老师 (tā bù shì lǎo shī) - He is not a teacher.  
- 你要不要？(nǐ yào bù yào?) - Do you want [it] or not?

**Usage Notes**:  
- 不 (bù) is used before verbs/adjectives for the present/future tense to negate them.  
- Changes to "bú" (bú) before fourth-tone words (e.g., bú shì (不是)) for smoother pronunciation.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine the horizontal line blocking or "not letting" something pass, like a bar: "not allowed."  
- 不 (bù) sounds like "boo!" - a clear "no!" or rejection.
