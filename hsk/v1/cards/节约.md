# **节约 (jiéyuē) - to save; to economize**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 节 (jié): Top-⺮(bamboo radical), Bottom-即(jí, meaning "namely"). Originally related to bamboo joints, now means "festival" or "to save."  
- 约 (yuē): Left-纟(sī, silk radical), Right-勺(sháo, spoon). Together, means "to restrict," "agreement," or in this context, "to economize."

**Examples**:  
- 我们要节约用水。(Wǒmen yào jiéyuē yòng shuǐ.) - We must save water.  
- 节约能源很重要。(Jiéyuē néngyuán hěn zhòngyào.) - Saving energy is very important.  
- 他很会节约钱。(Tā hěn huì jiéyuē qián.) - He is good at saving money.

**Usage Notes**:  
节约 (jiéyuē) is typically used with objects like 水 (shuǐ, water), 电 (diàn, electricity), 钱 (qián, money), and 时间 (shíjiān, time). It has a formal, positive tone.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine "节 (jié, joint)" as a way to "cut segments" (cut expenses), and "约 (yuē, agreement/restrict)" as "binding tightly," so together: tightly controlling segments = saving resources.
