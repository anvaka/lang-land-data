# **夫妇 (fū fù) - married couple; husband and wife**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 夫 (fū): Means "man" or "husband." Top: horizontal line for "one" (一 yī); Middle: 'big' (大 dà) below, signifying an adult male.  
- 妇 (fù): Means "woman," especially as "wife." Left: "woman" radical (女 nǚ); Right: "broom" component (帚 zhǒu), implying traditional domestic roles.

**Examples**:  
- 他们是一对幸福的夫妇。(Tāmen shì yī duì xìngfú de fūfù.) - They are a happy couple.

**Usage Notes**:  
夫妇 (fūfù) is a formal and neutral way to refer to a married man and woman together. Commonly used in news, writing, or polite speech; less casual than "夫妻" (fūqī) but similar in meaning.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think "夫" (fū) = husband, "妇" (fù) = wife; together, 夫妇 (fūfù) forms a balanced pair-like two partners standing side by side.
