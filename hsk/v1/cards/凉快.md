# **凉快 (liángkuai) - cool; pleasantly cool**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **凉** (liáng): Left = "冫" (bīng, ice, left component) + Right = "京" (jīng, capital, right component). "冫" (bīng) at left hints at coldness.  
- **快** (kuai): Left = "忄" (xīn, heart, left component) + Right = "夬" (guài, decision). "忄" (xīn) signals emotions/feelings.

**Examples**:  
- 今天很凉快。(Jīntiān hěn liángkuai.) - Today is very cool.  
- 晚上比较凉快。(Wǎnshàng bǐjiào liángkuai.) - It's cooler at night.  
- 开窗让房间更凉快。(Kāi chuāng ràng fángjiān gèng liángkuai.) - Open the windows to make the room cooler.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **凉快** (liángkuai) describes pleasantly cool weather or temperature, not as cold as "冷" (lěng).  
- Used in spoken language and daily conversation.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of "冰" (bīng, ice) on the left of **凉** (liáng) for "cool," and "快" (kuai, happy) as feeling happy in comfortably cool weather.
