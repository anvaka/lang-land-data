# **趟 (tàng) - Measure word for trips/rounds**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **趟** (tàng): Left side is **走** (zǒu, walk) as the radical, indicating movement. Right side is **尚** (shàng), acting as the phonetic component. The radical sits on the left (horizontal), and the phonetic component on the right.

**Examples**:  
- 我(wǒ)去(qù)了一趟(yī tàng)商店(shāngdiàn)。 (Wǒ qù le yī tàng shāngdiàn.) - I made a trip to the store.  
- 你(nǐ)来(lái)过(guò)几趟(jǐ tàng)了(le)？ (Nǐ lái guò jǐ tàng le?) - How many times have you come?  
- 他(tā)跑(pǎo)了(le)一趟(yī tàng)银行(yínháng)。 (Tā pǎo le yī tàng yínháng.) - He ran a trip to the bank.

**Usage Notes**:  
**趟** (tàng) is a measure word used for the number of trips, times traveled, or rounds of movement (e.g., by walking, riding, or transferring). It focuses on the action of going and coming rather than the result.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of **走** (zǒu, walk) plus an "extra" (尚(shàng)), so **趟** (tàng) refers to trips or times you "walk" or move somewhere.
