# **样子 (yàngzi) - appearance; look; manner**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **样 (yàng)**: "appearance; kind; sample". Left: 木 (mù, "wood") radical relates to "thing/object", right: 羊 (yáng, "sheep") phonetic component.  
- **子 (zi)**: "child; son; suffix for noun forms". The whole character depicts a child (子, zi) wrapped in swaddling clothes.

**Examples**:  
- 你的样子很可爱。(Nǐ de yàngzi hěn kě'ài.) - Your appearance is very cute.  
- 他伤心的样子让我难过。(Tā shāngxīn de yàngzi ràng wǒ nánguò.) - His sad appearance makes me feel bad.  
- 请照着这个样子做。(Qǐng zhàozhe zhège yàngzi zuò.) - Please do it in this way.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **样子 (yàngzi)** is a noun. Describes someone's/something's outward appearance, attitude, or way of doing something.  
- Often follows with adjectives or verbs to describe the state or style (e.g., 高兴的样子 (gāoxìng de yàngzi), "happy look").

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a "sheep (羊, yáng) on wood (木, mù)"-it's a sample "appearance" you might see on a farm.  
- 子 (zi) is often a suffix that makes words into nouns, like "child" as a concrete form.
