# **姐姐 (jiějie) - Older sister**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 姐 (jiě): Left side is 女 (nǚ, "female/female radical"), right side is 且 (qiě, originally a phonetic component). Means "elder sister".  
- 姐 (jie): Repeats for affectionate/reduplicative effect.

**Examples**:  
- 我有两个姐姐。(Wǒ yǒu liǎng gè jiějie.) - I have two older sisters.  
- 姐姐在学校学习。(Jiějie zài xuéxiào xuéxí.) - Older sister studies at school.  
- 这是我的姐姐。(Zhè shì wǒ de jiějie.) - This is my older sister.

**Usage Notes**:  
- Used for one's older sister(s), either by birth or as a respectful form for older females.  
- Doubling indicates familiarity and affection; single 姐 (jiě) is rare.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 女 (nǚ) + 且 (qiě): Think "female" + "again," as in someone who was a girl before you-your older sister.  
- The double "姐 (jiě)" is like calling kindly, "Sister, sister!"
