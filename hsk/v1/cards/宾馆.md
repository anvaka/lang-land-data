# **宾馆 (bīnguǎn) - Hotel**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **宾 (bīn)**: "Guest." Top: 宀 (mián, "roof/shelter"); inside: 兵 (bīng, "soldier") - a guest under a roof like a soldier under shelter.  
- **馆 (guǎn)**: "Building, hall." Left: 饣 (shí, "food" radical); right: 官 (guān, "official") - a building where people (often officials or guests) are provided food.

**Examples**:  
- 这家宾馆很安静。(Zhè jiā bīnguǎn hěn ānjìng.) - This hotel is very quiet.  
- 宾馆里有餐厅吗？(Bīnguǎn lǐ yǒu cāntīng ma?) - Is there a restaurant in the hotel?  
- 我们住在那家宾馆。(Wǒmen zhù zài nà jiā bīnguǎn.) - We are staying at that hotel.

**Usage Notes**:  
宾馆 (bīnguǎn) is commonly used in China for "hotel" or "guesthouse," often less luxurious than 酒店 (jiǔdiàn). 宾馆 (bīnguǎn) focuses on guest accommodation.

**Memory Aids**:  
宾 (bīn) = a guest under a roof; 馆 (guǎn) = a building where guests eat - so 宾馆 (bīnguǎn) is a place for guests to stay and eat.
