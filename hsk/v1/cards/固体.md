# **固体 (gù tǐ) - solid**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **固 (gù)**: Means "firm, solid, secure." Left: "因 (yīn)" enclosure radical (outside), right: "古 (gǔ)" (inside), hinting at something ancient and stable within boundaries.  
- **体 (tǐ)**: Means "body, form, substance." Left: "亻 (rén)" person radical (left), right: "本 (běn)" (right), suggesting the essential form of something.

**Examples**:  
- 水变成固体了。(Shuǐ biàn chéng gù tǐ le.) - Water turned into a solid.  
- 固体食品容易保存。(Gù tǐ shí pǐn róng yì bǎo cún.) - Solid foods are easy to preserve.  
- 冰是水的固体状态。(Bīng shì shuǐ de gù tǐ zhuàng tài.) - Ice is water’s solid state.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **固体 (gù tǐ)** is mainly used in scientific or descriptive contexts to contrast with **液体 (yè tǐ)** (liquid) and **气体 (qì tǐ)** (gas).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think “固 (gù)” as "glued/firm," and “体 (tǐ)” as "body"-so solid is a "firm body."
