# **轻 (qīng) - light (in weight); gentle**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 轻 (qīng):
  - Left: 车 (chē) - "cart" or "vehicle" radical, suggesting movement or transport
  - Right: 丁 (dīng) - "nail," often used phonetically
  - Together: Something easily moved or not heavy

**Examples**:  
- 这个包很轻。(Zhège bāo hěn qīng.) - This bag is very light.  
- 轻声说话。(Qīng shēng shuōhuà.) - Speak in a gentle/soft voice.  
- 请轻拿轻放。(Qǐng qīng ná qīng fàng.) - Please handle with care (literally: lift lightly, place lightly).

**Usage Notes**:  
- 轻 (qīng) is mainly used for weight or a gentle manner, not brightness (which uses 亮 (liàng)).  
- Often forms opposites with 重 (zhòng) ("heavy").

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think: A cart (车 chē) carrying a nail (丁 dīng) is “light” (轻 qīng).  
- 轻 (qīng) = "car" + "nail" = light enough for a cart to move with just a nail.
