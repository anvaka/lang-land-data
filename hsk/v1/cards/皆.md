# **皆 (jiē) - all; everyone**

- 皆 (jiē): Top: 比 (bǐ, compare); Bottom: 白 (bái, white). Originally depicts people side by side ("compare" + "white" as clarity) → meaning "all" or "everyone".

**Examples**:  
- 我们皆(jiē)是朋友。(Wǒmen jiē shì péngyǒu.) - We are all friends.  
- 众人皆(jiē)知此事。(Zhòngrén jiē zhī cǐ shì.) - Everyone knows about this.  
- 他们皆(jiē)到场了。(Tāmen jiē dàochǎng le.) - They have all arrived.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 皆(jiē) is literary/formal; commonly used in writing, classical texts, or formal speech. In casual conversation, 都(dōu) is preferred.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine comparing (比(bǐ)) white (白(bái)) objects lined up, representing "all" together; "compare all the whites" = "all".
