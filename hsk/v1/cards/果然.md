**Character Breakdown**:  
- **果 (guǒ)**: top = 田 (tián, "field"), bottom = 木 (mù, "tree"); overall means "fruit" or "result."  
- **然 (rán)**: left = 灬 (huǒ, "fire" at the bottom), right = 月 (yuè, "moon"/"meat") + 肰 (rán; a phonetic component); means "so" or "thus."

**Examples**:  
- 他 (tā) 果然 (guǒ rán) 来了 (lái le)。 (tā guǒ rán lái le) - He really did come, as expected.  
- 天气 (tiān qì) 预报 (yù bào) 果然 (guǒ rán) 没错 (méi cuò)。 (tiān qì yù bào guǒ rán méi cuò) - The weather forecast was indeed correct.  
- 她 (tā) 说 (shuō) 会 (huì) 赢 (yíng)，果然 (guǒ rán) 赢 (yíng) 了 (le)。 (tā shuō huì yíng, guǒ rán yíng le) - She said she would win, and sure enough, she did.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 果然 (guǒ rán) usually goes before the verb or at the start of the result clause.  
- Used to confirm expectations or show that the outcome was as predicted.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 果然 (guǒ rán): "果 (guǒ)" = "fruit," "然 (rán)" = "so/just as"-so things turn out as the "fruit/result" you expected!
