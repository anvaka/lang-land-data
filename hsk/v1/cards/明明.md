# **明明 (míngmíng) - Clearly; obviously**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **明 (míng)**: "Bright, clear." Left: "日 (rì)" (sun) on the left and "月 (yuè)" (moon) on the right-together symbolizing clarity and brightness.  
- **明 (míng)**: Repeated for emphasis; duplication intensifies the meaning to "obviously" or "undoubtedly."

**Examples**:  
- 你 (nǐ) 明明 (míngmíng) 说 (shuō) 过 (guò) 了 (le)! (You clearly said it before!)  
- 他 (tā) 明明 (míngmíng) 在 (zài) 房间 (fángjiān)，却 (què) 不 (bù) 出来 (chūlái)。 (He is obviously in the room, yet doesn't come out.)  
- 这 (zhè) 明明 (míngmíng) 是 (shì) 错误 (cuòwù)。 (This is obviously a mistake.)

**Usage Notes**:  
明明 (míngmíng) is an adverb, often used to stress that something is clear or obvious-sometimes expressing frustration.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of two 明 (míng)-as if turning on both a sun and a moon light to make something **extra clear**!
