# **塌 (tā) - collapse; fall in**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 塌 (tā): Left: 土 (tǔ, soil/earth) radical indicates relation to ground; Right: the phonetic component "塔" (tǎ, tower) minus the top "宀" (mián, roof), giving the pronunciation and suggesting a structure falling.

**Examples**:  
- 房子塌了。(Fángzi tā le.) - The house collapsed.  
- 桥塌了。(Qiáo tā le.) - The bridge fell in.  
- 墙突然塌下来了。(Qiáng tūrán tā xiàlai le.) - The wall suddenly caved in.

**Usage Notes**:  
塌 (tā) is a verb, often used for buildings, bridges, roofs, or anything that can physically collapse or cave in.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine earth (土 tǔ) at the bottom as a structure falls on top of it-"土" catches what 塌 (tā) causes to fall!
