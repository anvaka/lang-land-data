**Usage Notes**:  
- 繁体字 (fán tǐ zì) refers specifically to "traditional Chinese characters," mainly used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau.  
- 对应 (duì yìng) 的 (de) "简体字 (jiǎn tǐ zì)" means "simplified characters."

- "体 (tǐ)" means the "form/style," and "字 (zì)" means "character"-together: "complex form characters."
