# **巩固 (gǒng gù) - Strengthen; consolidate**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 巩 (gǒng): "To strengthen." Radical: 工 (gōng, "work") on left; 贝 (bèi, "shell") on right. Originally related to sturdy structures or fortification.  
- 固 (gù): "Stable, solid." Radical: 囗 (wéi, enclosure) outside; 古 (gǔ, "ancient") inside. Suggests something ancient and firmly enclosed-thus, solid.

**Examples**:  
- 我们需要巩固(gǒng gù)学到的知识。(Wǒmen xūyào gǒng gù xuédào de zhīshì.) - We need to consolidate the knowledge we've learned.  
- 要巩固(gǒng gù)基础，先多练习。(Yào gǒng gù jīchǔ, xiān duō liànxí.) - To strengthen the basics, practice more first.  
- 老师帮我们巩固(gǒng gù)语法点。(Lǎoshī bāng wǒmen gǒng gù yǔfǎ diǎn.) - The teacher helps us reinforce grammar points.

**Usage Notes**:  
Often follows a verb structure: 巩固(gǒng gù) + object (e.g., 知识(zhīshi), 基础(jīchǔ)); used in academic, work, or self-improvement contexts.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think of 工(gōng) (work, effort) + 贝(bèi) (valuable, like money) = making something valuable stronger. 固(gù), with the mouth 囗(wéi) enclosing the old 古(gǔ): ancient and solid, protected from outside. Combining both: to make something strong and secure.
