# **格外 (gé wài) - Especially; Particularly**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **格 (gé)**: "Standard; pattern." Left side is the “木 (mù)” ('wood'), right is “各 (gè)” ('each'; top is "夂 (zhǐ)", bottom is "口 (kǒu)").  
- **外 (wài)**: "Outside." Left is “夕 (xī)” ('evening'), right is “卜 (bǔ)” ('divination stick').

**Examples**:  
- 今天天气格外冷。(Jīntiān tiānqì géwài lěng.) - Today is especially cold.  
- 她格外喜欢喝茶。(Tā géwài xǐhuan hē chá.) - She particularly likes drinking tea.  
- 他工作格外努力。(Tā gōngzuò géwài nǔlì.) - He works especially hard.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **格外 (géwài)** is used before adjectives or verbs to express a strong degree, similar to "especially" or "particularly" in English.  
- Common in both spoken and written Chinese.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think “格 (gé)” = “standard,” and “外 (wài)” = “outside” - so something is “outside the standard” (i.e., stands out, is special/especially so).
