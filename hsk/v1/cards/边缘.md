# **边缘 (biān yuán) - Edge; Margin; Fringe**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **边 (biān)**: "side" or "edge." Left is the 辶 (chuò) radical ("walk" on the bottom-left), right is 力 (lì, "strength") indicating movement or transition.  
- **缘 (yuán)**: "edge," "fate," or "connection." Left is 纟 (sī, silk radical) signifying thread (inside-left), right is 彖 (tuàn, comprising 彑 [jì] on top, 豕 [shǐ] on bottom) suggesting a link or connection.

**Examples**:  
- 房子的边缘 (fángzi de biān yuán) - The edge of the house  
- 他站在社会的边缘 (tā zhàn zài shèhuì de biān yuán) - He stands on the margins of society  
- 请不要踩到草坪的边缘 (qǐng bú yào cǎi dào cǎopíng de biān yuán) - Please don't step on the edge of the lawn

**Usage Notes**:  
边缘 (biān yuán) refers both to physical edges (like boundaries) and figurative margins (like "social margins"). Often appears with "化 (huà)" as in 边缘化 (biān yuán huà) - "to marginalize".

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine 边 (biān) as "walking (辶, chuò)" to the "edge."  
- 缘 (yuán) contains the "silk thread (纟, sī)" as if connecting or outlining the edge.
