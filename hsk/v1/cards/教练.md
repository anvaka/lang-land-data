# **教练 (jiàoliàn) - Coach / Instructor**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **教 (jiào)**: “to teach”; left: 攵 (pū, “to tap/strike”), right (top): 孝 (xiào, “filial”; child under elder), indicating imparting knowledge.  
- **练 (liàn)**: “to practice/train”; left: 纟 (sī, silk radical, representing thread), right: 东 (dōng, “east”), suggesting threading together skills repeatedly.

**Examples**:  
- 教练(jiàoliàn)正在指导大家。(zhèngzài zhǐdǎo dàjiā.) - The coach is instructing everyone.  
- 我喜欢我的游泳教练(wǒ xǐhuan wǒ de yóuyǒng jiàoliàn)。- I like my swimming coach.  
- 她成为了一名足球教练(tā chéngwéi le yī míng zúqiú jiàoliàn)。- She became a soccer coach.

**Usage Notes**:  
教练(jiàoliàn) is used for sports or activity instructors; can refer to both the title ("Coach") and occupation.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: 教(jiào, teach) + 练(liàn, train) = person who “teaches training” - a coach!  
教(jiào) looks like a teacher giving lessons; 练(liàn) has the “thread” radical, like weaving practice.
