# **变迁 (biànqiān) - Change; transition**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **变** (biàn): change, transform. Left/right: Left side is “又” (yòu, again/hand), right is “𠂇” (piě, slash), altogether conveys transformation.  
- **迁** (qiān): move, shift. Top/bottom: Top is “⺧” (niú, cow radical), bottom is “止” (zhǐ, stop), indicating movement from one position to another.

**Examples**:  
- 社会变迁 (shèhuì biànqiān) - Social change  
- 城市不断变迁 (chéngshì bùduàn biànqiān) - The city is constantly changing  
- 历史的变迁影响了人们的生活 (lìshǐ de biànqiān yǐngxiǎng le rénmen de shēnghuó) - Historical changes have influenced people's lives

**Usage Notes**:  
- **变迁** (biànqiān) is often used for large-scale, gradual changes, especially regarding society, history, or environments. More formal than just **变** (biàn).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Picture a cow (**牛** (niú)) on the move (**迁** (qiān)): as it walks, things **change** (**变** (biàn)) behind it.  
- "Change and move" = "transition" or "evolution" - link the two meanings together.
