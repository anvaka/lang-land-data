# **兑现 (duìxiàn) - to fulfill, to cash (a check, etc.)**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **兑 (duì)**: Top: "儿 (ér)" (son/radical); Bottom: "八 (bā)" (eight/divide); originally means "exchange" or "convert."  
- **现 (xiàn)**: Left: "王 (wáng)" (king/jade, meaning precious/valuable); Right: "见 (jiàn)" (to see); together, means "current" or "present" (as in "cash" = present money).

**Examples**:  
- 我(wǒ)们(men)必(bì)须(xū)兌(duì)现(xiàn)承(chéng)诺(nuò)。(We must fulfill our promise.)  
- 他(tā)去(qù)银(yín)行(háng)兌(duì)现(xiàn)了(le)支(zhī)票(piào)。(He went to the bank to cash a check.)  
- 政府(zhèngfǔ)正在(zhèngzài)努力(nǔlì)兌(duì)现(xiàn)竞选(jìngxuǎn)承诺(chéngnuò)。(The government is working hard to fulfill campaign promises.)

**Usage Notes**:  
兌现(duìxiàn) is used for both literal (cashing checks, redeeming money) and figurative (fulfilling promises, carrying out plans) senses. Often follows a thing being fulfilled: 承诺(chéngnuò), 支票(zhīpiào).

**Memory Aids**:  
Think 兑(duì) as "exchange" + 现(xiàn) as "make real/present" = "make something real through exchange" → fulfill or cash.
