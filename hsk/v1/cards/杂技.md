# **杂技 (zájì) - Acrobatics**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 杂 (zá): "mixed, miscellaneous." The radical 木 (mù, "wood") is on the left, and the phonetic 朿 (cì) is on the right.  
- 技 (jì): "skill, technique." The 扌 (shǒu, "hand") radical is on the left, indicating action, with 支 (zhī) on the right.

**Examples**:  
- 我喜欢看杂技表演。(Wǒ xǐhuān kàn zájì biǎoyǎn.) - I like watching acrobatic performances.  
- 杂技演员很厉害。(Zájì yǎnyuán hěn lìhài.) - Acrobats are very skilled.  
- 中国杂技世界闻名。(Zhōngguó zájì shìjiè wénmíng.) - Chinese acrobatics are world-famous.

**Usage Notes**:  
杂技 (zájì) commonly refers to circus or stage acrobatics. Used as a noun, often with words like 表演 (biǎoyǎn, "performance").

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine a "mix" (杂 zá) of "skills" (技 jì) is what makes acrobatics! The hands (扌 shǒu) in 技 (jì) remind you that acrobatics need great manual dexterity.
