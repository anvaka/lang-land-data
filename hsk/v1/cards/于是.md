# **于是 (yú shì) - so; therefore**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 于 (yú): preposition meaning "at," "in," or "to." Top: horizontal line; bottom: component similar to "大" (dà) but with a short horizontal above it.  
- 是 (shì): means "is" or "to be." Top: radical "日" (rì, sun); bottom: radical "正" (zhèng, correct) with a horizontal stroke below.

**Examples**:  
- 天下雨了，于是 (yú shì) 我们回家了。(Tiān xià yǔ le, yú shì wǒmen huí jiā le.) - It started raining, so we went home.  
- 我吃饱了，于是 (yú shì) 去散步。(Wǒ chī bǎo le, yú shì qù sànbù.) - I was full, so I went for a walk.  
- 他没来，于是 (yú shì) 我自己做了。(Tā méi lái, yú shì wǒ zìjǐ zuò le.) - He didn’t come, so I did it myself.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 于 (yú)是 (shì) connects two sentences; the first gives a reason, the second shows the result. Often used in written or formal contexts.  
- Similar to "so" or "therefore" in English.

**Memory Aids**:  
- 于 (yú) and 是 (shì) together: Imagine you are "at" (于 yú) a situation, and as a result, "be" (是 shì) something happens-so "thus" or "therefore."  
- Remember: 于 (yú)像鱼 (yú, fish, same pronunciation)游到结果 (shì, result)-so!
