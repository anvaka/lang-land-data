# **复制 (fùzhì) - to copy / to duplicate**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **复 (fù)**: Top: "𠂉" suggests "to return"; bottom: "夂" means "go". Together, suggests "repeat" or "again."  
- **制 (zhì)**: Left: "刂" (knife radical) indicates cutting/making; right: "制" phonetic gives sound & sense of "making" or "control."

**Examples**:  
- 请复制(zhì)这个文件。(qǐng fùzhì zhège wénjiàn.) - Please copy this file.  
- 他复制(fùzhì)了老师的答案。(tā fùzhì le lǎoshī de dá'àn.) - He copied the teacher's answers.  
- 你能复制(fùzhì)这张图片吗？(nǐ néng fùzhì zhè zhāng túpiàn ma?) - Can you copy this picture?

**Usage Notes**:  
- 复制(fùzhì) is often used for digital or mechanical copying (e.g., files, images), not for handwriting (that would be 抄写(chāoxiě)).  
- Noun form: 复制品(fùzhìpǐn) - "copy; replica."

**Memory Aids**:  
- **复(fù)** means to do again, and **制(zhì)** is about making things-so 复制(fùzhì) is "make again" = "copy."  
- Picture yourself "returning" (复(fù)) to "make" (制(zhì)) something once more.
