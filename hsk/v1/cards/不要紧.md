# **不要紧 (bù yàojǐn) - It doesn't matter / It's not serious**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 不 (bù): "not"; left-right structure; top is "一" (yī) meaning "one", and bottom is a hook, representing negative.  
- 要 (yào): "want, need"; top is "西" (xī, west) and bottom is "女" (nǚ, woman).  
- 紧 (jǐn): "tight, urgent"; left is "纟" (sī, silk radical), right is "艮" (gěn, tough).

**Examples**:  
- 没关系，不要紧。(Méi guānxi, bù yàojǐn.) - It's okay, no problem.  
- 他摔倒了，不过不要紧。(Tā shuāi dǎo le, búguò bù yàojǐn.) - He fell, but it’s not serious.  
- 忘记带书也不要紧。(Wàngjì dài shū yě bù yàojǐn.) - Forgetting your book isn’t a big deal either.

**Usage Notes**:  
不要紧 (bù yàojǐn) is mainly used to comfort someone, show that something is not serious, or say "it's fine." Similar to 没关系 (méi guānxi), but more about the severity of a matter.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine something "紧" (jǐn, tight) happening, but you say "不" (bù, not) + "要紧" (yàojǐn, important/tight) = "It’s not urgent!" So, it's really "not tight," relaxed, don’t worry.
