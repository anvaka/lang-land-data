# **上当 (shàng dàng) - To be deceived / To be fooled**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 上 (shàng): "up" or "to go on." The radical 一 (yī, "one") is at the top; the component 口 (kǒu, "mouth") is often at the bottom in ancient forms.  
- 当 (dàng): "appropriate," "to encounter," or "to be." The top radical is 小 (xiǎo, "small"), under which is the right-side 内 (nèi, "inside") component.

**Examples**:  
- 我 (wǒ) 上当 (shàng dàng) 了 (le)。 (wǒ shàng dàng le) - I was fooled.  
- 不要 (bù yào) 上当 (shàng dàng) 受骗 (shòu piàn)。 (bù yào shàng dàng shòu piàn) - Don’t be deceived and cheated.  
- 很多 (hěn duō) 人 (rén) 都 (dōu) 上当 (shàng dàng) 了 (le)。 (hěn duō rén dōu shàng dàng le) - Many people were tricked.

**Usage Notes**:  
上当 (shàng dàng) is usually used in negative contexts to express having been tricked or deceived. Commonly used with 了 (le, completed action). Can be combined with 受骗 (shòu piàn, "be cheated").

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine "going up" (上, shàng) to a "trap" (think of 当, dàng, sounding like "done"), so when you 上当 (shàng dàng), you "go up to get done"-falling into someone’s trick!
