# **登机牌 (dēng jī pái) - Boarding pass**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **登** (dēng): to board/climb; top: 癶 (bō, footstep radical), bottom: bean radical 豆 (dòu)  
- **机** (jī): machine; left: 木 (mù, wood radical), right: 几 (jī, table)  
- **牌** (pái): card/sign; left: 木 (mù, wood), right: 卑 (bēi, low/base)

**Examples**:  
- 请出示您的登机牌。(Qǐng chūshì nín de dēngjī pái.) - Please show your boarding pass.  
- 我找不到我的登机牌。(Wǒ zhǎo bu dào wǒ de dēngjī pái.) - I can't find my boarding pass.  
- 登机牌在行李里。(Dēngjī pái zài xínglǐ lǐ.) - The boarding pass is in the luggage.

**Usage Notes**:  
**登机牌** (dēngjī pái) is commonly used in airports. It refers to the document needed to board an airplane. It’s countable: 一张登机牌 (yī zhāng dēngjī pái) - one boarding pass.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think "**登** (dēng) = board," "**机** (jī) = plane (machine)," "**牌** (pái) = card," so it's the card for boarding the plane. Visualize “登机”(dēngjī) as “climb onto the machine,” and “牌” (pái) as “card you hold up.”
