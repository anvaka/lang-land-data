# **树立 (shù lì) - to establish; to set up**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **树 (shù)**: tree; to plant. Left: 木 (mù, wood/radical), right: 对 (duì, phonetically hints pronunciation).  
- **立 (lì)**: to stand; to set up. Top: 立 (lì), pictogram of a person standing upright.

**Examples**:  
- 我们需要树立(shù lì)正确的价值观。(Wǒmen xūyào shùlì zhèngquè de jiàzhíguān.) - We need to establish correct values.  
- 他在公司树立(shù lì)了良好的形象。(Tā zài gōngsī shùlìle liánghǎo de xíngxiàng.) - He has established a good image in the company.  
- 教师应帮助学生树立(shù lì)自信心。(Jiàoshī yīng bāngzhù xuéshēng shùlì zìxìnxīn.) - Teachers should help students build self-confidence.

**Usage Notes**:  
树立(shù lì) is often followed by abstract nouns (e.g., 目标(mùbiāo), 观念(guānniàn), 信心(xìnxīn)). Used formally for concepts or attitudes rather than physical things.

**Memory Aids**:  
Imagine planting (树(shù)) a sign to stand (立(lì)) upright-when you "establish" something, you set it up firmly like planting a tree that stands tall.
