# **让 (ràng) - to let; to allow; to make**

**Character Breakdown**:  
让 (ràng)  
- Left: 讠(yán) - speech radical (indicates relation to speaking).  
- Right: 上 (shàng) - means "up" or "above", used here for sound only.

**Examples**:  
- 请让(ràng)一下。(Qǐng ràng yīxià.) - Please make way.  
- 妈妈让(ràng)我做作业。(Māma ràng wǒ zuò zuòyè.) - Mom made me do homework.  
- 他让我(ràng wǒ)很开心。(Tā ràng wǒ hěn kāixīn.) - He makes me happy.

**Usage Notes**:  
让 (ràng) is used to indicate permission, causing someone to do something, or letting/making someone do something. Often appears before a verb.

**Memory Aids**:  
Think: "SPEECH (讠yán) lets things happen (让 ràng)!" The speech radical shows you’re letting words or actions pass.
