# **弟弟 (dìdi) - Younger brother**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 弟 (dì): Means "younger brother." Top: "丿" (piě) "slash" and "八" (bā) "eight" components. Bottom: "弓" (gōng) means "bow." Historically, resembles the idea of a junior or lower rank.  
- 弟 (dì): Character is doubled to form the affectionate, familiar term.

**Examples**:  
- 我有一个弟弟。(Wǒ yǒu yī gè dìdi.) - I have a younger brother.  
- 弟弟喜欢踢足球。(Dìdi xǐhuān tī zúqiú.) - Younger brother likes playing soccer.  
- 这是我的弟弟。(Zhè shì wǒ de dìdi.) - This is my younger brother.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 弟弟 (dìdi) refers only to a male sibling younger than you.  
- Talking about someone else’s younger brother, add their surname or title: 王先生的弟弟 (Wáng xiānsheng de dìdi).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Remember "弟弟" (dìdi) by the repeated "dì": Two of "弟" (dì) sound playful, just like a little brother!  
- Imagine the bottom "弓" (gōng) “bow” as a toy a younger brother often plays with.
