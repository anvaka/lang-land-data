# **太太 (tài tai) - Mrs.; wife; madam**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **太 (tài)**: "very; too; greatest."
  - *Radical*: 大 (dà, "big"; left, bottom, and right stroke), with a dot (丶, zhǔ, "dot"; top) added for emphasis or extension.  
- **太 (tài)**: Repeats for politeness-shows respect or denotes femininity in this context.

**Examples**:  
- 这是我太太。(Zhè shì wǒ tài tai.) - This is my wife.  
- 王太太很友好。(Wáng tài tai hěn yǒu hǎo.) - Mrs. Wang is very friendly.  
- 李先生和他的太太住在这里。(Lǐ xiān shēng hé tā de tài tai zhù zài zhè lǐ.) - Mr. Li and his wife live here.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **太太 (tài tai)** is commonly used for someone else’s wife or addressing a married woman respectfully (e.g., 王太太(wáng tài tai) = Mrs. Wang). Less often used for referring to one’s own wife in younger generations (who may say 老婆(lǎo po)).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine *two* 太 (tài) together means "very very" important-a *wife* or *madam* is someone highly respected (double importance).  
- Picture the top dot in 太 (tài) as a special mark to make “big” (大, dà) even greater, just as a wife is a key family member.
