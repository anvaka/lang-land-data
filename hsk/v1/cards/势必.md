# **势必 (shìbì) - Bound to; certain to; inevitably**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **势** (shì): "power, momentum, tendency". Left: **埶** (shì, "to control") as phonetic; right: **力** (lì, "strength") on the right.  
- **必** (bì): "certain, must". Main component: "heart" radical **心** (xīn) at the bottom, covered by strokes above, indicating strong intention.

**Examples**:  
- 他(Tā) 办法(bànfǎ) 一定(yídìng) 不够(búgòu)，势必(shìbì) 失败(shībài)。 - His methods are not enough, he is bound to fail.  
- 这种(zhèzhǒng) 决定(juédìng) 势必(shìbì) 引起(yǐnqǐ) 讨论(tǎolùn)。 - This decision will certainly trigger discussions.  
- 新(xīn) 技术(jìshù) 的(de) 出现(chūxiàn) 势必(shìbì) 改变(gǎibiàn) 行业(hángyè)。 - The emergence of new technology is bound to change the industry.

**Usage Notes**:  
- **势必** (shìbì) is often used before verbs to indicate something is certain or inevitable. Formal and used in both speech and writing.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Think: When the **势** (shì, "momentum") is so strong, the result is **必** (bì, "inevitable"). With enough force, something must (必) happen.
