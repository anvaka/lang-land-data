# **晒 (shài) - to sun/dry, to bask**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 晒 (shài):
  - Left: 日 (rì, "sun" radical) - represents sunlight.
  - Right: 西 (xī, "west") - suggests exposure, as the west is where the sun sets.

**Examples**:  
- 我在晒衣服。(Wǒ zài shài yīfu.) - I am drying clothes in the sun.  
- 今天很热，不能晒太久。(Jīntiān hěn rè, bùnéng shài tài jiǔ.) - It's very hot today; can't be in the sun for long.  
- 他喜欢晒太阳。(Tā xǐhuān shài tàiyáng.) - He likes sunbathing.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 晒 (shài) often means exposing things to sunlight (clothes, food, oneself).  
- Also used figuratively in internet slang as "show off" (e.g., 晒照片 shài zhàopiàn = post photos online).

**Memory Aids**:  
- The 日 (rì, "sun") on the left reminds you it involves sunlight; 西 (xī, "west") hints at the sun setting, thus exposing to light.  
- Think: "晒 (shài) = show to the sun (rì) from the west (xī) side."
