# **岁月 (suìyuè) - years; time; passing of time**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- 岁 (suì): means "year" (of age). The top 扌(shǒu) is the "hand" radical, under which is 山 (shān - mountain). Originally, it referred to harvesting grain, now commonly refers to age or years.  
- 月 (yuè): means "moon" or "month". The radical 月(yuè) appears as the whole character, suggesting the monthly lunar cycle.

**Examples**:  
- 岁月 (suìyuè) 不饶人 (bù ráo rén)。- Time waits for no one.  
- 美好的 (měi hǎo de) 岁月 (suìyuè) 总是短暂 (zǒng shì duǎn zàn)。- Good times are always short.  
- 她怀念 (tā huái niàn) 年轻的 (nián qīng de) 岁月 (suìyuè)。- She misses her youthful days.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 岁月 (suìyuè) is often poetic or nostalgic, referring to the passage of time or life experiences, not simply calendar years.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine 岁 (suì) as counting years in the mountains (山, shān) by hand (扌, shǒu), and 月 (yuè) as the moon marking months; together, they emphasize flowing time.
