# **押金 (yā jīn) - Deposit**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **押 (yā)**: "to pledge or deposit." Left: 扌(shǒu - hand radical) on the left, indicating an action; right: 甲(jiǎ - shell/armor), referencing value/safe-keeping.  
- **金 (jīn)**: "gold, money." Entire character is a common term for metal or money; contains 钅(jīn - gold radical) on the left, and 亽(jī - sitting person) above two dots on right.

**Examples**:  
- 请交押金。(Qǐng jiāo yā jīn.) - Please pay the deposit.  
- 押金多少？(Yā jīn duō shǎo?) - How much is the deposit?  
- 退还押金。(Tuì huán yā jīn.) - Return the deposit.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 押金(yā jīn) is used for refundable deposits (rent, hotel, bicycle).  
- For "down payment," use 定金(dìng jīn).

**Memory Aids**:  
- 押(yā) has "hand" (扌shǒu) + "protect what’s valuable" (甲jiǎ), just like handing over something for safekeeping.  
- 金(jīn) is "gold/money," so 押金(yā jīn) = "pledged money."
