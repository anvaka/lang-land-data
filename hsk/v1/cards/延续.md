# **延续 (yánxù) - to continue; to go on**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **延 (yán)**: Left = 辶(chuò, "walk" radical); right = 正 (zhèng, "correct"). Means "to extend" or "to delay".  
- **续 (xù)**: Left = 纟(sī, "silk" radical, indicating relation to threads); right = 声 (shēng, "sound" or "voice"). Means "to continue", originally "threads following on".

**Examples**:  
- 传统得以延续。(chuántǒng déyǐ yánxù.) - Tradition can be continued.  
- 他的工作将由别人延续。(tā de gōngzuò jiāng yóu biérén yánxù.) - His work will be continued by others.  
- 他们的友谊一直延续到现在。(tāmen de yǒuyì yīzhí yánxù dào xiànzài.) - Their friendship has continued until now.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 延续 (yánxù) is often used for abstract things (history, tradition, belief).  
- Can be used as verb or noun (如 "历史的延续" (lìshǐ de yánxù) - "continuation of history").

**Memory Aids**:  
- 延 (yán): Imagine "walking" (辶 (chuò)) to "extend" (正 (zhèng)) time.  
- 续 (xù): Picture "silk threads" (纟 (sī)) "continuing" (声 (shēng)) endlessly.
