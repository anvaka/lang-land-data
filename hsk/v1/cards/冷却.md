# **冷却 (lěng què) - to cool, cooling down**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **冷 (lěng)**: "cold"; left/side has 冫("ice" radical, left), right side is 令 (lìng, "order" or "command"). Original meaning relates to coldness.  
- **却 (què)**: "to retreat", "but"; top has 卩 (jié, "seal" radical, right side), left/bottom is 去 (qù, "to go"). Conveys turning away or causing to become not hot.

**Examples**:  
- 水正在冷却。 (Shuǐ zhèngzài lěngquè.) - The water is cooling down.  
- 冷却系统很重要。 (Lěngquè xìtǒng hěn zhòngyào.) - The cooling system is very important.  
- 金属需要冷却后才能加工。 (Jīnshǔ xūyào lěngquè hòu cáinéng jiāgōng.) - The metal must be cooled before it can be processed.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 冷却 (lěngquè) is often used in technical/scientific contexts for physical cooling, not for feeling “less enthusiastic” (see 冷淡 lěngdàn).  
- Can be both a verb and a noun (e.g. 冷却过程 lěngquè guòchéng, "the cooling process").

**Memory Aids**:  
- 冷 (lěng) has the "ice" radical, reminding you it's about cold.  
- 却 (què) looks a bit like a person turning away under a cover-think of heat being “pushed away.”
