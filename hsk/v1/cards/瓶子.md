# **瓶子 (píng zi) - Bottle**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **瓶 (píng)**: Left - "瓦 (wǎ)" radical (clay tile, related to pottery/ceramics); right - "并 (bìng)", originally means "combine". Together, hints at a vessel made of clay.  
- **子 (zi)**: Refers to "child" or a nominal suffix; bottom - "了 (le)" shape, top - small "roof" line.

**Examples**:  
- 桌子上有一个瓶子。(Zhuō zi shàng yǒu yī gè píng zi.) - There is a bottle on the table.  
- 这个瓶子(zhè gè píng zi)里装满了水。(lǐ zhuāng mǎn le shuǐ.) - This bottle is filled with water.  
- 请把瓶子(qǐng bǎ píng zi)递给我。(dì gěi wǒ.) - Please pass me the bottle.

**Usage Notes**:  
- 瓶子(píng zi) is a noun; add a measure word like 个(gè) or 支(zhī) depending on context.  
- Used for most containers shaped like a bottle (e.g., plastic, glass).

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine "瓶 (píng)" is like an ancient clay bottle (瓦 (wǎ) = tile) containing things (子 (zi) = small, container).  
- "瓶子(píng zi)" sounds like "ping"--like the bottle makes a "ping" sound when tapped!
