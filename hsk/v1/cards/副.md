# **副 (fù) - measure word for sets, pairs; vice-, deputy**

**Character Breakdown**:  
- **副 (fù)**: Left component is "刂 (dāo)" meaning "knife" (right side), suggesting cutting/separation. Right main structure is "畐 (fú)" (top: "一 (yī)", middle: "田 (tián)", bottom: "口 (kǒu)"), sometimes related to fullness or measure.

**Examples**:  
- 一副眼镜 (yí fù yǎn jìng) - a pair of glasses  
- 副主任 (fù zhǔ rèn) - deputy director  
- 这副画很漂亮 (zhè fù huà hěn piào liàng) - This painting is very beautiful

**Usage Notes**:  
- **副 (fù)** is a measure word for items in pairs or sets: e.g. hands, gloves, glasses, paintings.  
- Used before job titles to mean "vice-" or "deputy", e.g., 副校长 (fù xiào zhǎng): vice principal.

**Memory Aids**:  
- Imagine a "pair" (set) is something you might divide with a "knife (刂 dāo)" and group together. "副 (fù)" rhymes with "few"-think "a few things make a set."
